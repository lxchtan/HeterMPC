o it s probably not terrible since one is uninstallable without the other 0
it added a dep on ubuntu keyboard autoiplot which is n t there on arm64 also for utopic note that
main reason for asking is i d like an sru looked at approved which adds apport hooks into the vivid
did you check with riddell about fixing it i do n t think the sru team maintain a vanguard person
excellent idea riddell would you have time to look at the kscreen 5 3 2 autopkgtest failure or consider whether
that s not good i think they does n t necessarily overlap either it s probably not terrible since one
that would have at least avoided me releasing one without the other i do n t know i m afraid
main reason for asking is i d like an sru looked at approved which adds apport hooks into the vivid
for people who do n t the phased update percentages are n t considered ok 0
i first thought it might be related to https launchpad net ubuntu source unity scopes api 0 6 19 15
must run though it would seem like a bug if u m is removing grub2 signed to do the upgrade
good news we got apt logs and they confirm that update manager did n t do a stupid having a
rbasak and i were also discussing the idea of modifying sru release to warn if you try to release grub2
can we somehow bind the phasing of those together i do n t think he is see meeting 1
less urgent more need this before we get more crap bugs that whole nginx postinstall script failure nonuseful debug data
true ack 1
i suggested having a list of hardcoded special packages which it ll refuse to touch if you mention without a
this is the bit of code it hits if its any use http bazaar launchpad net ubuntu weather dev ubuntu
right but without context and the layout on the phones it s hard to figure out what the translation should
ack and thx if you set the destination ppa to the overlay you can click publish on it 0
what s the output of apt cache policy phablet tools citrain you re welcome 1
and get well soon what muppet wrote that 0
robru the ppa changed then i guess any particular reason for that thanks will sleep it off tonight 1
but i will also double check on my phone yeah but i do n t want to force translators to
there you go resurrected brendand for you how else are they supposed to see new untranslated or changed strings 1
ok i am confident that if it s in the process s address space munmap dtrt in this context but
if we treat translation changes as safer you could update just the langpacks post testing great 0
not sure think that was hijacked from the old app let me check we already do something like that since
pong thx 0
19kmh is about 12 mph hey 1
silo 2 why did you leave wily vivid as a target and remove trusty precise 0
brb got to reboot however if i swipe up the s s panel and relaunch it sees the change 0
ok the second one seems normal what muppet wrote that 0
what happens when you tap on the log in youtube button but i m probably slightly different than community folk
even though the account has been created and permission granted de facto if it s been mapped into the process
i guess that s a bug in system settings wait does it asks you to authorize a service or to
barry have n t pinged back yes 1
the button does n t do anything apparently ooooh 0
can you please try without the silo both please 0
mind filing a bug np i m currently filling my armory 1
one of the branches got a trunk merge after it was built in the silo so there s no change
flash proposed image we can safely ignore that commit 1
just not sure what the result s gon na be when publishing should i i apparently ca n t log
hmm good question might cause some problems ok 0
thx try watch only but with all the recent changes that robert made i m not sure if watch only
om26er has been trying to install silo 55 in ota7 without luck that s kind of good news 1
hm no i do n t think so it ll likely just go back to dirty the next time it
we already do something like that since lp has the new strings earlier the problem is that they do not
check my email on phone ml since it s already landed can you please file a couple of bugs 1
one is the local permission to use the account the other one is google request to authorize the app but
can you tell me exactly your steps ooooooo 0
1 system settings accounts create google account 3 open contacts click on import contacts from google 0
i do not have controls over these libraries i can try push a new build on the silo to check
you 3 open contacts click on import contacts from google 1
at this point the google login page appears bfiller i think we have to rebuild silo 55 0
i mean for the refresh interval to test it is actually refreshing do n t you get the transfer icon
yes http paste ubuntu com 12893637 0
but no error sorry you had trouble 0
yes they are on proposed that s weird so there is a working sync after creating the account but it
did you install the first version of buteo landing which was later reverted right so now you change from test
i m latest using rc proposed is there a timestamp on the data 0
yes but i mean if you once installed that broken silo the accounts db file might still contain wrong infos
https trello com c sof1beka 2397 540 ubuntu landing 055 address book service bfiller unless you wiped the device 1
right use information the device is wiped for each silo 1
ok then please can you try again while running this 2 9999 online accounts service step install the last version
in any case could you please try again with 2 9999 online accounts service http paste ubuntu com 12893637 1
that s without the silo mind filing a bug 0
you know what it s not using the same account it s actually creating another account i see 0
i suppose it s not recognizing the existing one what muppet wrote that 0
can you also paste the output of account console show google account id where the google account id is returned
https pastebin canonical com 142430 that option would override this check yes i m just trying to reason through if
oh and i almost forgot about your request added that person now sorry for the delay thanks looks like this
in calendar ack 0
nice contacts calendar same thing 1
ah ok ah so wily overlay ppa 0
slangasek ok bileto trunk is updated for xenial just waiting on webops to do a rollout vanguard is on lunch
i wanted to know why i could n t find it and i also wanted to know it was done
kudos on picking up the behemoth silo let me know please if you have any questions are you testing the
i have an mp for that in any case could you please try again with 2 9999 online accounts service
we ve segfaulted you do n t get to do any other cleanup in this case silo 1
forget it it was an expected error i followed the test plan 0
ok hm no i do n t think so 1
https trello com c sof1beka 2397 540 ubuntu landing 055 address book service bfiller cool 0
should be installed in rc proposed instead haha who wrote this 0
http people canonical com alan weather com ubuntu 0 click for you fixes your bug did we update evolution data
i do n t know i guess that s a bug in system settings 0
i do not have controls over these libraries i can try push a new build on the silo to check
i could install it in rc proposed you know what it s not using the same account it s actually
but om26er was trying to do it in ota7 as explained in the merge proposal i suppose it s not
ota7 lacks dependencies do i need to change something in the silo to create packages for ota7 1
thank you possibly so thanks 0
ok i see the test plan ask to install ota6 i will update that nice 0
ok using munmap 0
pong done 1
same url i will update the mr description 0
this is the bit of code it hits if its any use http bazaar launchpad net ubuntu weather dev ubuntu
flash without wiping it ll make xenial newer 0
cool let me try to hit publish yeah they are the same as they were previously 1
renatu has updated the steps see above do you have the latest citrain 0
ok sorry i have been updating the test plan page https wiki ubuntu com process merges testplan buteo sync did
and where is the logic that tells it to land xenial to the main archive instead of the overlay ppa
i thought well that bug number one not fixed and then i tapped the today and up it scrolled very
oh you mean the numbers would change good point oh right do n t worry i was using test plan
both providers on the default location page for any day including today first train publication to xenial is progressing 0
indeed 19 kph 19mph more like 12mph oh and i almost forgot about your request added that person now sorry
haha who wrote this that s kind of good news 0
ermmmmmm i forget his name do n t you get the transfer icon in the indicators as soon as you
bath is a long way from wolverhampton dude right investigating you can report a bug and assign to me if
haha so if you change the temperature from c to f i bet the wind value will change maybe he
have you seen brendand i m worried silo 22 kiled him it seems to be gleefully removing most of the
oh bath is a long way from wolverhampton dude 1
what muppet wrote that launchpad bug 1508998 in ubuntu weather app numbers are not recalculated on unit change for wind
when i unset autodownloading with system image cli system settings says otherwise i would probably need permissions to do that
sure you could load you cache folder with the data from the autopilot tests 0
why did you leave wily vivid as a target and remove trusty precise added link to the citrain task 1
thanks sent 0
give us a ping if you find any more it is complaning about evolution data server libraries and stdc versions
i mean slangasek but is not consistent with system settings 1
both providers on the default location page for any day including today when i unset autodownloading with system image cli
test b i guess that s a bug in system settings 1
change the time on your clock 0
who owns system settings these days ok the second one seems normal 0
ask kenvandine system up to date 0
both providers on the default location page for any day including today how can tell if the refresh has happened
after the phone is rebooted i rm f etc system image config d ini when the spinner stops spinning or
system up to date i mean for the refresh interval to test it is actually refreshing 1
well i do n t know whether the problem is in system settings or in system image but i did
did you see my second question about where the logic lives to tell it that xenial is landing to the
the device is wiped for each silo i followed the test plan 1
note that for s i 3 you only follow the first test a and b i suppose i should relabel
yeah i figured this is the bit of code it hits if its any use http bazaar launchpad net ubuntu
oh yeah just slept a bit late feeling fresh now oh right do n t worry i was using test
right that would have been the one phablet team tools thanks i ll have a look after 1
sweet ah i m not authorized to upload 0
oh right heh on it rvr hey mostly jgdx and myself 1
fine right hmm i see auto download never now 1
reminds me we need to stop using info if you backport s i 3 to vivid overlay right that s
right use information i m guessing it caches it and does n t recheck 0
bzr blame will tell us i have an mp for that 1
not sure what it has to do with the fact you do n t take regular baths cool rvr jgdx
while page open or do you back re enter ok 0
ok i need to run out for a bit back re enter 1
ack that sends a dbus signal 1
but it downloads the image again yes it should send a settingchanged signal with the key and new value 1
well should be easy to get po diffs kenvandine swipe up relaunch does work 1
as i did n t get the notification i stopped to ask whether that was expected or not kenvandine rvr
mind filing a bug first train publication to xenial is progressing 0
ack i think i left off a step after printf ing to ini system image dbus needs to be restarted
i see yes please 0
it reloads the page but does n t go away hmm 1
flash proposed image i m re running test b to check the rest of it 1
okay jgdx kenvandine lp 1509022 the device is wiped for each silo 0
great thanks you need to install the packages on silo 0
thanks silos now can also be marked as dirty if someone pushes a new commit to any of the branches
ignore dest thx 1
test b the silo does not contain buteo sync plugins contacts google it only contains address book service 0
open system settings panel https launchpad net ci train ppa service archive ubuntu landing 055 0
or if the data changes i go to updates 1
thanks for doing that going to grab lunch quickly bbiab did you install the first version of buteo landing which
ok i see the test plan ask to install ota6 i will update that great 1
ok did n t start the switch yet i m deep in qt debugging now robru sick rvr davmor2 anything
thanks for doing that going to grab lunch quickly bbiab cool wiki page updated 1
have you seen brendand i m worried silo 22 kiled him excellent thanks now just the train needs to be
not more issues and where is the logic that tells it to land xenial to the main archive instead of
cool 1 system settings accounts create google account 0
in calendar summary i like the sendfile idea but want to discuss further why you classify unmapping of graphics buffers
one bug for both is fine yup just read through your comment so the problem is it is not as
unless it was changed in settings ok why is it not that simple 1
we use gralloc with a binaryblob providing us with the actual implementation ok then please can you try again while
popey that s better we do n t call munmap but would call into a binary blob we do n
haha so if you change the temperature from c to f i bet the wind value will change so mapped
yes pong 1
yeah check the latest commit at lp cupstream2distro i m guessing it caches it and does n t recheck 0
good news for the silo but it s not working as expected sure although i would like to make sure
hmmm i wonder how badly the opening of xenial will exacerbate our disk space issues in the train i wanted
heh looking at the scrollback yeah i somehow missed your entire second message there the silo does not contain buteo
stuff is building do you still need the copy do n t get me wrong minimizing the memory footprint is
have a mns to check something w me step install the last version of the package buteo sync plugins contacts
sure what s up hey i see the xenial series is up on lp feel free to do the wily
yeah not sure sorry i ve never seen a project enforce copyright checks at build time or at least i
what do we need to do for that yeah i figured 0
right so now you change from test on your device to test on a 40gu ah that s what you
that s fine it s a bin copy pong 0
the thing is there wo n t be any more copies from wily overlay to xenial so if we let
do i need to wait for the copied binaries to be published for xenial before publishing again or is it
i would wait i m not sure how that would work if you did n t maybe he has no
ahayzen yay new app on stable phone o well yeah because snakefruit needs to call copypackage do if it s
do you have the latest citrain ppa ubuntu sdk team 0
i m reading the steps here https code launchpad net renatofilho address book service fix facebook account import merge 275076
this would be the result of different package versions in wily vs in xenial left wily vivid for transitional purposes
i do n t understand why address book service appears in that error message twice with two different version numbers
cool i do n t understand why address book service appears in that error message twice with two different version
0212 is the vivid version 0
unless it was changed in settings this is really weird hang on 1
you did n t delete the wily version that might be related need to bin copy wily packages to xenial
check my email on phone ml ok it looks legit the 1015 version being complained about is in the changelog
slangasek ok xenial vivid is live in bileto production feel free to publish when you get back 1
let me install si 3 0 2 from the silo and test it thanks man 1
yeah something like that sounds like you did not install grub right 1
its crash seg faulted twice on me and thats after having login loop problems with the live cd checking 1
ahh thanks i hopes its cause you have no other choice 0
lots of services missing from dolphin but even the available downloads are lacking however i use unp to extract in

i notived that the pastebin widget was also missing these days was very useful hello what is the password for
well i am testing it really running in a vm right now it looks like it has some really interesting
yeah that makes sense im happy enough that most of my new laptop worked with 15 10 http scribblesandsnaps com
yeah something like that i am following this tuto http askubuntu com questions 420005 can not add ppa ppayannubuntu boot
unp oh i tried all sorts of things half of which i can not remember 1
most stable think some blacklisting the intel gpu in favour of the nvidia since it s more capable handling video
hehehe you just jump right on in there eh d regarding servicemenus in dolphin try this sudo ln s usr
error i totally agree although its something i will have to look at later im in the if it is
well thanks that worked here 1
can i ask what that does before i go ahead and run it i have to be careful i do
unp is available in the repos hehehe you just jump right on in there eh d 1
hello what is the password for live user kubuntu 15 10 so pretty safe then 1
optimus eh i m a home user no worries about breaking stuff since i use 14 04 as my backup

have fun restart the machine 0
well has anyone tried 4 14 digikam in 14 04 kubuntu why did you choose kubuntu if i may ask
i would have thought same starts with login screen with live session user as username but after install finish 0
yeah it s a pita on linux unfortunately i ve seen that on broken files live sessions like the user
did you do a full hdd install from the usb stick that was asking you for a login at the
so you have a broken live usb session and reasonable enough it gave you a broken hdd installation thanks that
your hmmm reburn the iso to usb checking 0
how did you burn it i mean what did you issue for dd lots of services missing from dolphin but
well there s always the 14 04 lts yeah that makes sense im happy enough that most of my new

it would be best to assign the be a static ip no that is the local loopback device 0
that was mythical well is n t that 1
do you mean 192 is not static when would such problems occur i guess so 1
you ll need to use that on both the frontend and the backend there s no guessing either you did
192 168 100 22 i guess so 0

is it working now if the pc reboots it could receive a different ip from that pool 0
if the pc reboots it could receive a different ip from that pool at least partly i could watch tv
but even that works now thanks for support then you ll be back to where you started today 0
look into assigning your backend a static ip address to avoid future problems what is the right database name and
well technically you don t you could look in it to find your username and password and then just type
if you do n t understand dhcp vs static then your pc s are leasing an ip from a pool

in jujusvg that might help us with this ci issue that might be a good option i do n t
yeah it just gets stuck at connecting to the ip verifying stilson 07 is 10 245 67 135 s our
yup you should see that ip via either the vpn or the bouncer you around 0
i have just arrived though a little low on caffeine you can use ctrl l to enter the location 0
ok another dumb question how do i get the select file dialog to show dot files it says to pick
just a check or more have to do that the next days too np ping if anything else comes up
yes enjoy just saw that dimiter commented is with jfdi 0
1 22 is superseded in our ppas by 1 23 and the packaging rules know it is an error to
alexisb mramm and xwwt to agree to purge our ppa and rush a 1 22 fix out which means 1
i rubber stamped it yes i will add the 1 23 task to the bug 1
ahh ok i do n t know whether or not bug 1437266 need be fixed in 1 24 or 1
ic i need them to 1
we should run any steps that have n t already been run but i m pretty we should n t
why do you need them soo 1 23 1 24 master 0
i meant another work but since i dont know it in english my brain replaced with oneliner i think i
i can get in via our ssh bouncer i mean this code was wrong before and obviously no test was
regardless natefinch you have given me something i can work with i expect the testing is already there in state
perrito666 ah there should be a test that checks that the step was run this is not giving me anything
bug 1450631 was opened something is injecting gopkg in juju charm v6 unstable into the tree blocker ci packaging juju
ps jw4 did you get credentials to see test results so teststatestepsfor122 should be failing 1
there is a separate test for the function being run if that is what worries you can i consider you
i was n t going to bring it up wink yeah it would be good to see if there is
i trust ericsnow s judgement i am here 0
go with it i am really glad it s useful 0
or the step rather me too 1
if the bug you re fixing is actually urgent you have discretion but it seems that issue does n t
i already hit merge anyway p ok ty will look 0
hopefully 1
and it really is a convoluted web ahh ok 1
just with the changes it looks like all we re testing is that the upgrade step has the right description
but again htat was already there only in the wrong version the merge of the patch got delayed until 1
well there is no way to test that the upgrade function does what it says correct it will not be
i m sure there s a way to test that the upgrade function at least calls addenvuuidtocharms they mean the
it is sadly much larger now but the commit history should make sense to you no worries i know how
i think i need an account to explain to the irs that i did pay tax on the sale of
done i did too 2 years back but have since only vaugue recollections nightmares about config 0
i think one of things you are trying to merge is injecting charm v6 unstable either we document that it
so do i it is the burocratic weight of the stamp what i was looking for but this is heavy
sounds like a good idea but now also the fix does n t match the listed fixes so i ve
i m trying to connect to stilson 7 but even connected to the vpn i ca n t even ping
good question no idea sinzui 1
this fixes the critical blocker http reviews vapour ws r 1532 are you using the make release tarball script 1
thanks for the help got it working that error looks like the checks that ensure every package in the tarball
thank you it s me and i m only trying to merge a pr into master 1
only 5 files changes dependencies are unchanged good question 0
if you brought charm v6 definitely its a bigger change we where using v5 yesterday i understand now ty 0
no i haven t no change of imports and i just scanned the code here no where found and the
i rubber stamped it on the bright side upgrade jenkins branches ran to completion without errors 1
wow ugh i ve sent an email with the details 0
i think i just fdigured it out yeah you might want to take some time out 1
i think i need an account to explain to the irs that i did pay tax on the sale of
that s great thx yep 1
bbiab certainly seems like a good idea i wish i knew more of how the packaging process worked i might
the container does n t have our build deps ppa attached so it is pure trusty but i do n
bug 1450265 was opened juju depends on google golang org cloud compute metadata but is not included in dependencies tsv
jujusvg s only consumer should be charmstore sorry i was in a meeting tal now 1
there are other areas in the codebase that will fail if control bucket defaults to it looks like it may
control is an illusion ty 1
sorry high level is n t the right word what s the opposite of comprehensive uhg we did n t
because it s charmstore that actually causes the transitive download of jujusvg maybe 1
not yet hmm my ci output shows extant directories unknown gopkg in juju charm v6 unstable any idea what this
word alexisb is still working on that 1
very likely the trigger https github com juju jujusvg pull 28 we need 1 23 to do the fix an
that s crazy congrats on one of those bits of news we could ask jujusvg folks to tag our revision
hmm got a fix for 1 24 but ci does n t accept it sigh then we might be able
katco while changing our dep to jujusvg in every branch might work around this issue we can not go back
jujusvg is not in dependencies tsv for 1 22 strange i only ported a fix a few code lines 0
oh i see what you are saying jw4 i think you are right and this means that older branches are
if you get a mo can i have a stamp on http reviews vapour ws r 1473 yeah i m
thanks for explanation i just wanted to be 100 sure that setting the default to would n t accidentally fail
that s why ci is complaining i think you are correct 1
right so i am searching all of juju core dependencies for charm v6 but we ca n t use gopkg
makyo will tag for us thanks makyo 1 24 and master 1
it s a transitive dependency not sure if there s a better way that s what i do 0
hence we know something happened outside of juju seems like we should be able to have an automated check that
you are misunderstanding what unknownattrs are github com juju jujusvg master refers to charm v6 1
thanks i m not saying it make it i just wanted to be sure the ticket was n t targetted
shall i just ask ci to start again exactly 1
is this what you expect for the tag command that s why ci is complaining 1
that is the error you will not find it because it is not supposed to be there and i m
no as in none of juju core s dependencies are referencing charm v6 unstable katco while changing our dep to
anyway that s the problem jujusvg does 1
and all merging branches not just ci yep that s whats happening 0
is the tag just v1 no as in none of juju core s dependencies are referencing charm v6 unstable 0
but if not in the version that s pinned why is it causing problems effectively juju is not utilizing a
so go get pulls down jujusvg master which refers to charm v6 causing charm v6 to be pulled down yep
jw4 will gladly tag but i m a little curious why is jujusvg showing up in core 1
merge might be but the rules to make the tar ball do n t besides i think godeps is still
jujusvg s only consumer should be charmstore i ll see you all around 0
not that juju core uses it ah sorry that makes sense let me check 0
exactly not that juju core uses it 0
law thx for walking me around the block on that 1
law because ci checks that all dependencies downloaded are accounted for 1
right not at all 1
i understand now ty whereas the deployer stuff being borked prevents us improving our tests to catch issues like lxc
yup you should see that ip via either the vpn or the bouncer alright thanks 1
makyo will tag for us thanks makyo thx 0
select network manager vpn connections configure vpn later morpheus 0 1
sinzui if need be i can roll it back i went with a branch for v1 wonder if the functionality
that actually makes some sense we could n t release a 1 23 with it but we have time before
thanks oh wow 0
np ping if anything else comes up around that they mean the network icon in the top right there 0
anyone used the canonical vpn i ca n t understand their directions seems like they re missing a step shall
we have to update dependencies tsv but i just realized charmstore will have to use the gopkg version surely that
sorry i had all these changes in patches that a testing script applied after checkout jw4 my family insists we
anyone used the canonical vpn i ca n t understand their directions seems like they re missing a step ack
but again htat was already there only in the wrong version the merge of the patch got delayed until 1
thanks soo 1 23 1 24 master 0
i ll be in and out the next few hours but appreciate it whenever you get that change in ok
np will do so they were never run nd hence missed picking up bugs 0
mgz discovered some months ago that go will always get all the deps in the git master branch even when

once it fails it fails until u8 restarts yeah and yes i think it just became more resilient but not
it might feel like a hack but the model is very abstract if your two views with different ids are
hi ok thanks 0
if i draw a surface twice in my qml scene should each item there have a different compositor user id
or work independently that s the multi monitor frame sync library technically you should get one user id per frame
and qtmir event feeder might have ignored the repeats you doing multi display 1
no i m doing having multiple items showing the same mir surface in a qml scene mir demos needs to
hi i m trying to record something with mir but i do n t know what s mir s server
but wondering if that s a wrong approach what in frontend wants to call on a surface 0
run lightdm mir o does n t work hmm still with a single display and a single id i imagine
yeah that was my intent using a unique id per qml item eg void this so that they get the
there is one for the unity system compositor and another one for the user session if you imagine user id
ah right so would that be a valid use of this compositor user id api or would that be a
it might feel like a hack but the model is very abstract if your two views with different ids are
so usc was repeating yes but frankly for the sake of opengl performance you should be binding the surface to
right or 0
i get very slow connections to the image server lately so it s a bit unexpected what you re doing
yeah the switcher or workspace previews is where i d expect to see the same texture used multiple times on
autopilot is triggering lots of key repeats now yeah i m reading the code and am seeing the mirclient resize
so it s a bit unexpected what you re doing but i do n t expect it will ever break
once it fails it fails until u8 restarts yeah and yes i think it just became more resilient but not
i believe back then we assumed that it was not necessary sure i do but the display config has only
bad assumption thanks d let s see 0
hm so how do you want that fixed i believe just getting the resize event somewhere isnt enough hello does
it is n t i can work around it 1
when do we expect to see 0 14 in wily usc window management 0
if i draw a surface twice in my qml scene should each item there have a different compositor user id
nearly but it s definitely something i ll want in future 0
not sure oh its working for me 1
but from usc hm so how do you want that fixed i believe just getting the resize event somewhere isnt
i think in the end we decided not to support it so it s a bit unexpected what you re
but it s definitely something i ll want in future yeah that s what i thought too but it s
yeah i m reading the code and am seeing the mirclient resize event being swallowed in mgn detail displaybuffer mirevent
ok thanks ah right 0
so would that be a valid use of this compositor user id api or would that be a hack are

you can always update grub to find windows two types in ubuntu adobeflash plugin or pepperflash which is in chrome
use chrome with build in pepperflash or use the pepperflash plugin installer that downloads chrome and extracts pepperflash for ff
usually manufacturer datasheets but looking at the current mainline linux kernel i ca n t find any driver module that
oerheks gave you install command for the pepperflash i am not able to configure my cpu fan 0
what browser are you running i get the xubuntu loading thing and the xubuntu login screen 0
looks like someone already mentioned you can just run chrome thanks ioria 0
okay so i have 1 1g free out of 3 4g ram and 4g swap the flash plugin packaged into
nobody is there in ubuntu ubuconla yeah it s a relatively recent problem but flash has a pretty bad past
so you have a bad cdrom try making a usb i think you have been answered go get pepperflash 1
yeah it s flash 18 in chrome right now you should be fine though at best what he did to
install flash installer from the repo s and then head on over to the adobe flash test page to see
im going to be doing a startup repair on my win7 partition soon and i m worried about it overwriting
oi do your research not not even close 1
you do n t have to just use synaptic or apt get or software center to install flash installer you
scratch that apt cdrom is a command not a program how so 1
you can use pepper in ff and other browsers yes pepper is googles response i am having problems installing skype
cat etc lightdm lightdm conf there is also a pepper flash installer in repo s pepperflashplugin nonfree pepper flash player
no web page link linux can be different than windows installations you mean smth like for file in dir do
looks good now sudo apt get install steam as previously mentioned use the software center or apt apt get or
software manager should already be installed on your system so will apt and apt get but they are terminal command
from your own url the repositories dictate which version of a program is available through them 1
samba is also another way best method is a personal preference you can install them at the same time and
matsy but does the process automatically erase the partitions linux only in a vm no dual etc booting 1
yeah with a multiboot setup herte windows and linux i just use a shared ntfs 1
why the vm try installing flash installer to see if that resolves the problem 0
maybe try gparted device create partition table i had returned it again i guess the gconf did n t work
or zero out the usb stick with the dd program sudo dd if dev zero of dev sdx bs 512
i think i figured it out thanks my issue now is that the iso is larger than the usb c

well do n t give the users r on the files x is needed to traverse the directory and see

not directly but you can use setterm to set various options and could put a setterm call in an executable

i did the setterm thing in my bashrc on a server so when i login it changes the terminal text

okay that s not what we want you already installed right not accessible the filename directory name or volume label
oddly enough only 14 04 is available to me yeah that was the installer 1
ok no problem yeah the other one is to make package out of it and integrate it into the system
okay so you ran the netbeans installer already and stepped through the wizard can anyone advice on this help would
no i am not installing it again man i do n t want to use noscript because i do n

i m not telling you install it again i m verifying you did install it actually just to be clear

without that the part never gets run synced 1
right i want packages to land in vivid and trusty only after upstream have published the simplestreams data for it
hm no idea about that in experimental 1
no that s fine thanks for the heads up thanks 1
hm no idea about that i guess it makes sense actually yeah 0

mmm i ve seen some fixes for that in debian 1

what do you mean exactly if i had a say in it and i do n t really i d

do n t wear one then just get a wall plug thing p looks like a merge for debian may
we can work around that in do release upgrade but there s nothing we can do for bare debootstrap some
six heads so 3 sli whatever the heck amd call it netkeyscript scary 1
oh you have commit on debian s mysql 5 6 i m currently building a fix for enabling the systemd
they also slightly changed the prompt string hmm hm ok should probably check whether installing form a server cd would
well i m happy to do the merge and test it both ways changes in 9 look fine are you
sure you want to ping me in an hour when you re back newline works fine i suppose they just
if you do n t mind please go right ahead i m going to be a while before i m
no that s fine thanks for the heads up thanks for the pollinate systemd fixes i committed those upstream 0
i meant yes i ll merge but that does n t seem to work under either upstart or systemd just
hi just a quick question is it expected that doing a dist upgrade on a server based install does try
bug 1429756 in upstart ubuntu fails in majority of cases high new https launchpad net bugs 1429756 no not expected
laney can we please add a force badtest on current upstart i just filed bug 1429756 and i m not
i see will try to reproduce and narrow it down but it happens when installing updates of some specific packages
ah and we do n t upgrade tasks on servers more meeting and then hockey today but can we talk
there s no ubuntu base we have ubuntu minimal which depends on init ubuntu standard which depends on systemd sysv
would you mind filing a bug about the server upgrade we need to figure out how to do that then
yes thank you i actually tried to type ubuntu standard damn fingers 1
shall i upload it now or do you have something else queued for mysql 5 6 yeah will do after
not expected i ve used it for months under systemd can you please file a bug with details chances are
we can work around that in do release upgrade but there s nothing we can do for bare debootstrap some
so maybe i m doing something wrong then apart from the noisy keyboard 0
not expected i ve used it for months under systemd can you please file a bug with details this is
do you mind if i quote you here either in paraphrasing or direct quotes in my response to their message
or is it that there s a xubuntu one but we need a generic xfce one for studio xubuntu etc
sorry a sru request to block an update to an existing version what do i misunderstand the packages that i
var cache debconf config dat maybe well it s not just an sru request is it n ow 1
we have an sru exception for juju so new releases theoretically should land in vivid and stable releases concurrently server
yeah i just have n t had the time to sit down and stare at it if the only thing
is fglrx still not ready it s a balance of human time to check programs vs build farm time mirror
there might be another installer bug about that already just with upstart not telling you about it it s not
this build is from 1h ago if lucky it will be there soon could i get a conditional ack depending
hey what can i do to synchronize pyotherside to vivid not sure what good a conditional ack does you you
the free driver is decent for desktop use fglrx is still better for gaming kinda hoping that s not true
the price performance ratio for amd video cards is hard to pass up the absolute top end flip flops every
but if you re doing high end 3d in linux the drivers matter a lot more than the cards and
oop my bad so free driver wise nouveau and radeon are both pretty decent these days 1
i mean interactively prompting during boot not the tty thing given how fglrx behaves with only one card and one
i ve been struggling to find a passively cooled one that also does enough heads yo 0
do n t wear one then just get a wall plug thing p i guess 0
should those be left against their own packages or filed against systemd i seem to experience bug 1429849 on my
i m not aware of it do you have installer logs handy please i wanted to let you know so
i got the vm at the point of fail so yes just need to send them over he mangled your
ok a tarball of all logs attached to the bug could not decide which one so i went for all
thanks i wonder if you can see debconf values anywhere it seemed to be quite nice many years ago then
i think that s not what the current case is in target var shall i just attach a copy of

i m looking at apache2 now specifically the ssl passphrase test thanks looks like d i debconf seeds are stored
ok not sure this is relevant but at least there is some list in config dat which has vda5 as
to be fair i m not sure that fixing the macro is actually much of a regression potential at all

launchpad bug 1429938 in openssh ubuntu systemd changes behavior of apt get remove openssh server undecided confirmed i think the

okay i suspect usr bin ecryptfs setup swap might need some new logic and not needing plymouth and this nvidia
larsu did an install with utopic btw that s not a new thing 1

and we can talk through it hallo wie gehts 0
ah ok more meeting and then hockey today but can we talk tomorrow morning i am around from 8am european
toss me a list good morning 0
and not needing plymouth and this nvidia and ati drivers in the initrd even on non plymounth systems and yes
or if i have to do it then at least have the choice of a free driver that is reasonable
i think it was already mentioned the regression potential is infinite and that it s a bad sru candidate apparently

and we can talk through it yeah it seems to be a libreoffice issue but if fixing it in glib
yeah i dropped a comment on the bug to that effect but am in no mood took a personal day
indeed oke 0
sorry for bugging you on your personal day i just wanted someone who has a familiarity with the bug issue
to be fair i m not sure that fixing the macro is actually much of a regression potential at all
s this thus but glib s rdep list is impressively long so some care is required 1
that wo n t magically fix the perowossname issue of course but my stack of jenkins failed mails is slowly
if this is fixable in just libreoffice that reduces the potential but if it ends up needing sru d with
given norbert and locutusofborg s comments on the bug though it looks like they were looking at glib updates which
for servers mostly the correct fix is in glib yes i was n t arguing otherwise 1
that said once glib is fixed a non determinate number of rdeps need to be rebuilt to make libreoffice happy

that said i think finding the exact package s that need s love to fix the libreoffice sadness is probably

when we had that discussion ages ago it would have been about powerpc the 32 bit arch not ppc64el done
thank you can you give me a reason message 0
sure i got it what bits are you having troubles pushing 0
if they want to the flavour leads have access to do that hahahah 0
it shows on http iso qa ubuntu com qatracker milestones 326 builds oh 0
oh sorry i did n t get that right yay thanks 1
certainly something to pay attention to when a release is out nevermind too impatient did n t when i looked
when i have tried in the past they start but then get stuck ok release announcement coming soon then 0
that s when i would suggest bugging someone about it i ve seen issues like that in the past and
its ok i guess its pretty rare we need to rebuild dailies so not much of hassle to bug someone
you going to call kubuntu ready anyways certainly something to pay attention to when a release is out 1
looking i would normally only force rebuild when they are broken not a huge problem if it takes 1 extra
beat me to it by a hair i m not sure i ever recall you reporting this before or if
yes something like that i just know its required manual intervention the few times i have tried them 0
the question is if this file can be used from etc or etc xdg or usr share something controls also
it would be best to use the system config file for a change to the iso ok help answered my
what is the actual fontmanager application you are using the font manager from our menu in 1404 does not use
only ubuntu studio has that set up for the first user anything else based on ubuntu wo n t good
hehe my question echoed in me http www freedesktop org software fontconfig fontconfig user html shows some system file locations
the trick would be to find where to put it that link actually came from the help that is part
but can we not put files in sparce the man as in manual 1
ah maybe i found type 1
not a very long one sorry i guess it is a files section search with files in a man page
not on plasma 5 15 10 now so cant say for the other stuff better is subjective i d just
temptation is too big playing around with updates is too funny and frustrating though i m missing that menu too
yes can i easly install kubuntu near my windows 7 0
how do you change it not sure about the wifi but there s a bug report for the icons a
alt space effects are you sure 0
de nada i ca n t find any setting for the task switcher alt tab thing 1
you should be able to choose between different task switchers with apt update 0
yes try another usb stick 1
sounds like install media issues try another stick dvd qucik question kmail crashed requiring reboot on reboot all window icons
it is a mess dualscreen does not work unless you restart plasmashell you ca n t erase or move mails
anyone else here feel that kde is bloated i have the dual screen issue at work intel too i fix
i think you can only acumulate bugs not swap p try goint to the display settings change any setting enable
ok hopefully nvidias new driver with kms support is out soon that should solve that 1
do you have a better description of the problem thats a plymouth issue 1
no networks were listed when it happened even though there are several around true and i tried that but that
rodolfojcj i think i have it intel i7 8gb of ram http askubuntu com questions 558366 how to show boot
gentoo arch have you tried to start using you ati drive r 0
i wan na try kubuntu this gui is perfect for me im a junior java dev so i will install
also you could use ides like netbeans and eclipse or use nice text editors like kate sublime vim etc i
when you say near do you mean the two partitions will be next to each other well the solution to
just set the partition to in the manual partitioning that should default to formatting it as ext4 and yes you
they should n t be i think the windows partition will continue on a ntfs partition and the kubuntu partition
the installer will take your original windows partition space then will resize it to open some space to be used
he already has a seperate partition create a file etc modprobe d blacklist nouveau conf 0
and you can learn other nice software development topics like python ruby erlang elixir as programming languages django as a
i have optimus intel nvidia and the nouveau driver was actually throwing shit every where are you using it most
ok ill give it a shot then you ll need a machine with powerful hardware 1
for me java is an enterprise crap bloatware and unstable as hell got a mac mini 6 2 i7 2
guys please tell me do you have the virtual terminals availble ctrl alt shift f1 through f5 or f6 or
my solution to that problem has been to go into virtual terminal move my home dir to the side home
looks like you have to upload from the picasa google site i ca n t learn it 0
hey folks you have access to the virtual terminals ctrl alt shift f2 or something maybe it is alt f2
sounds like your kde config is corrupt i m guessing here try copying your kde config off to the side
hmm it looks dead now i guess there is no way since apt get respect dependencies 1
i do n t think i can be of much help with that is your hard drive actually working 1
don t uninstall it home folder encryption thats it 1
what happened to you if you do n t need it just don t check and retry your install 1
hast is actually broken and do follow that link 0
you do have optimus or nvidia driver mine just was n t connecting the interface was up but i think
i ca n t learn it yes still got same problem 1
no it can use xrender is opengl required to run kde 1
but in order to owrk you need to select automatic adresses only that is too much 2 g should be
good morning hybernation maybe 1
well you may have to change settings in option panel i think the windows partition will continue on a ntfs
was n t too crazy about it what i had to to is blacklist the nouveau driver and install nvidia
don t uninstall it nonetheless in the java world there are interesting initiatives like grails groovy very useful language clojure
you just need to blacklist that shit alguien puede ayudarme con plasma 5 kde 0
robertopero skerit any ideas if it is gon na open again and when exactly i think the idea behind ubuntu
actually thinking of taking a 2 week leave so i can setup some stuff for myself 1
thanks so packages downloaded through ubuntu make do n t add a repository entry in sources as it seems like
actually the point behind that question is is the ubuntu make method preferred over a ppa officially why would you
the phones are flashed in the factory not by hand ok thanks 1
you cleared a lot of doubts thanks good to know its officially supported being developed by ubuntu canonical developers as
so maybe next week have a cookie 1
i think they expected stock to last longer on each batch sometimes i see a purchase button 1
from ubuntu official fb i saw purchase on the previous page 1
how many devices are sold i saw it in the second page too 1
yeah o d http i imgur com rn0vifa png how did u get that 1
https twitter com bqreaders need to refresh the page and sometimes you have the button 1
to put message onto sim on android press and hold that thread and see if there but then error 502
we should talk here so i can keep track do n t feel too bad we ll probably all have
i m making official that it s sad they don t would n t ship to finland ok once you
it does n t get stored refreshing enough of course skipping the game and then waiting that the add to
i do n t have add to cart button yet i think there were n t expecting this amount of
i was using english but i did n t have the add to cart see http i imgur com w9fxonc
that s ur cart not mine it has all bits 0
not good enough the calls might still get in somehow i would n t assume the deliver date is as
yay so in short yeah its an officially supported method to get moving 0
lucky on i saw purchase on the previous page 0
less risky not to on the process order page did you log in or fill the form because i trying
was there any announcement on a ubuntu tablet or something so are you the only one from this channel who
did u have to configure ur pack options befor eyou hit add to cart it is absolutely 12000 order request
i d have thought most zip libraries would be able to provide that info huh i hope everything okay with
its not a focus change it s a button press http popey mooo com screenshots device 2015 02 11 093532
i honestly think bq did n t expect this demand i do n t particularly like it but that s
where is this configuration unity8 did n t want to start cause of dbus a button press should trigger a
ogra sure for me what s the app 1
reminders 1
someone mentioned last night that sdl is available on ubuntu touch okay will take a quick look at it later
http www bq com gb ubuntu html at the moment i think only the options for which there is backend
this is where you can buy camera equipment no 1
okay i already reviewed 1 the other one requires to test on the phone i m updating my chroot i
then 502 on the checkout no problem 1
502 yes oh my i see the headlines ubuntu phone kills aws 1
i fetched a nexus 4 to flash and track devel once you re embarassed by your first time user experience
better start pushing for ubuntu tvs again users do n t automatically run to update their phones 0
tick tock it does not add much and it is useful for debugging wakey processes using eventstat 1
i even tried playing the whole game and scoring on all the steps that s just informational so if we
yes neo31 and mirv p 1
go jolla i ve heard the ubuntu phone is rubbish do n t even bother going on the website in
forget yes neo31 and mirv 0
what a great idea to build a case that shows the company logo instead of something actually useful proc 0
strange but according to my order number they re not selling them by the thousands atm you ll have more
ogra sure for me yes we re going to allow people to define their own 1
although i m not sure if that will be useful to do for anything page error 1
excellent better yet i got the infinite spinning loading page version 0
refreshing enough of course skipping the game and then waiting that the add to cart shows on the next page
you can still get used nexus 4 s dirt cheap lol 1
looool scooty loo i guess that s what happened well then buy that one 1
well the job is actually awesome but it does n t have anything to do with mobile devices exactly the
a nexus 4 but the shipping method is broken so you ca n t actually place the order 0
i do n t know the answers to those questions only bq does just remove the on lightdm stuff 0
at least the site stayed up this time someone secretly ordered 1000 devices 0
o me at morning but now adb didn works again i see it as device in adb devices but when
will test that now had to leave last night before jenkins finished building the new version yeah i m seeing
try wire transfer payment you ll have to wait until march anyway to get the phone yes neo31 and mirv
right and you use ubuntu device flash for that i guess is there something in ubuntu device flash to do
it s from dmesg i think they expected stock to last longer on each batch 1
hahah right so my question is how to provide a different rootfs 1
but seeing as shippments arrive in march i havent touched that code for a while but it used to work
that was quick and you can 1
kay will check it out so maybe a manual upload for the schemas 0
as bq images are not on cdi preinstalls robertopero skerit any ideas if it is gon na open again and
i flashed trusty on my old busted grouper and setup a chroot for builds d i do checkout now wooow
i just add like two files needed for hammerhead to the tar can i just disable lightdm to keep it
which i luckily own just apt get uprgade it that ll break it sufficiently not to start unity 1
kay will check it out you need to hack up etc7init android tools adbd conf 1
just flashed my 9300 the wifi does n t work but that will stop working soon as well since we
yep the first run iis to dip your foot in the water anyway not going to update it so it
so what do i need to change in android tools adbd conf same 0
e how about your fix for not handling the error 1
kgunn what am i working on oh you we where block with that let me do an mp with tours
also i created a property shownotimplementeditems to show hide not yet implemented functionality for now only privacy setting is visible
from which service i just get error msg when i click through on the purchase boohoo 0
i saw it in the second page too in this case we are not using a zip lib but a
the devices tar is just android build from phablet ubuntu com i do n t know how the ubuntu tar
that s my perspective too quite a bit of that looks like it s not even starting settings 1
sounds like an infrastructure issue 1
heh when messaging app imports a photo from gallery where does it get stored in messaging app 1
thank you whatever it is they were expecting less it seems 0
rtm proposed on krillin to be clear so confirmed the bug is fixed out of stock 0
np had to flash anyway yep 0
wfm if you want to do that just apt get uprgade it that ll break it sufficiently not to start
thanks i see it but what now i think a manual upload of the schema package is the only solution
still if they did sell 108k phones then wooho soulds like a success it s fine if the schema change
less risky not to al right i m misinformed then 0
did n t get there yet mirv receiving over 12 000 orders per minute does n t mean successful orders
someone on g claimed that someone from bq told him that it was just 250 units in the morning bq
i was just connecting the numbers from the backlog in here with kubuntu 0
i doubt it yeah i m just providing more data to speculate on 1
not sure about your app store foo you need to hack up etc7init android tools adbd conf 0
http ubuntu bq com fr checkout cart but the today and nearby scopes are bq material 1
lol shit this is bq hell not at the moment at least 1
anybody here having difficulty buying the new bq ubuntu phone all of europe mundo reader the parent company of bq

i inserted sim card and it works like before hmm possible install lg g2 mini ubuntu touch os 0
was there any announcement on a ubuntu tablet or something i removed it morning and then problems appear 1
thanks i d love to have anything at all like that for the attendees you have to wait for the
or just hack the website lol sdl isnt preinstalled no 1
i was about to build a template for that https github com sturmflut ubuntu touch sdl template but it s
the good news is its a success tnx to all devs and more devices will come hmm i dunno where
i ll ask heh 0
ya thanks i d love to have anything at all like that for the attendees 1
that s confirmed popey the lo interface is by default configured in etc network interfaces 1
well not remove but empty it thanks i see it but what now 1
i do n t know i do n t have your phone and i m not porting to it so
ill have to check not yet at least what mods kernel modules 1
you might have to do it inside the lxc container that the android bits are in you can probably reboot
people so waiting for the image so that they can buy android verison and flash it can you tell me
i m out this is stupid just look at the content of sys module 1
im from nigeria and once my uncle who was an ancestral king passes down his inheritance to me i will
thanks is this stuff made by bq then are there in general other device specific functions or apps yeah i
because you hate phone calls 1
alright thanks keep up the good work and dont forget about the nexus got ta be infrastructure 0
so my question is how did bq get the today and nearby scopes to the left of the app scope
magic p but get to your manage dash screen then press and hold weather and you can drag it around
ooh that must be really new because it has n t worked even a couple of months ago do n
does n t sound like it yeah it s from the manage dash redesign 1
only command promnt does it say grub on it 1
but it seems lubuntu is the only option to get a ubuntu minimal install no 1
only command promnt but it seems lubuntu is the only option to get a ubuntu minimal install 0
i got a good reason to wipe that drive if that happens i would try to restart lightdm the display
i disabled light locker with sleep and hibernation s installed installing 0
but it s not possible to write anything only command promnt flashes that is a complicated topic itself 0
but im sure thats not the main concern i ll just reinstall whole system cause of time 1
thank you for response which is exactly the functionality i want like i said this is literally a web browser
what did you install to get lubuntu then thats what you have 0
more like a life line correct that iso correct 1
s installed installing what exact package name lubuntu minimal 1
sudo apt get install lubuntu minimal often you can find docs for how to solve stuff using ubuntu but with
does lubuntu display a warning about guest sessions by default so what package did you install friend 1
mini iso whatever the installer labelled as minimal lubuntu which i assumed was n t actually a meta and rather
sudo apt get install lubuntu minimal what i would do is sudo apt get update sudo apt get dist upgrade
cool start is system wide before login 14 04 0
right i m confused as to why editing failsafe conf to skip the network check caused networkmanager to stop starting
does lubuntu display a warning about guest sessions by default lol not imaging these laptops they re literally 0 maintenance
im not sure how the operating system you installed works i have never personally used that setup in the mini
i like that some punishment for the spillers 14 04 was upstart afaik 0
more like a life line although just make sure you do n t think it will complete install at the
i find they all have compromises but with linux if i just give whomever needs it an actual user account
they have a wiki too which is exactly the functionality i want like i said this is literally a web
nothing about installing main lubuntu uprevents what you are stating you need guess they should n t spill beer on
that s why this is literally a 1 button wonder chrome icon is familiar to them chrome is familiar to
yeah i had that problem as well quick grub install once i booted solved it still annoying that it enumerates
i do n t think minimal comes with a firewall again that is in fact the point no interacting with
doubtful unless they re booting from usb which we re probably going to disable in the bios anyway hey all
oh sure but if they re that smart they re also smart enough to understand that you should have sealable
everything else is exactly as desired hmm i am not sure that is tested that much 1
what you mean you think it is something nobody use i want to use it for my everyday desktop use
what i try to do is to get a minimal ubuntu install without any desktop that has a nice frontend
i think you can get even more minimal witht eh ubuntu server iso for minimal virtual machine im not sure
the problem is i ca n t figure out what the differences is s installed installing 0
i do n t really trust myself installing that kind of stuff or thats what the users get unless they
what do you plan on using this minimal install for what exact package name lubuntu minimal 0
well thats the scneario that you are faced with im just stating what my experiences were implementing linux places i
yeah that but it seems lubuntu is the only option to get a ubuntu minimal install 1
sorry for confusing you my problem is that i travel a lot and do n t have access to internet
i usually use ethernet as my wifi adapters do n t work out of the box except for an really
thats what i would expect from the guest account if you have two laptops and an ethernet cable with linux
i guess i want a minimal distro without any application or desktop but all the security packages preinstalled and configured
for stuff like that i always suggest if you are dding and iso to lsblk before you dd you can
which versoin of lubuntu if debian works for out of box better for you then go with it 1
i do not want users to have the ability to do anything else i like debian but always run into
that is a complicated topic itself only problem was that the hdd was recognized as sdb and installation media was
did you download 15 04 or older often you can find docs for how to solve stuff using ubuntu but
we got an kubuntu offtopic sooo instead of me spending manual time reinstalling apps figured i would bash the thing
please do n t ask to ask a question simply ask the question all on one line and in the
looks like authorization for that action fails or even just type driver 0

an webinterface translation tool i have it not 100 sure if i want this design to be final 1

yesterday i saw the know bugs of 15 10 alpha for found that the ark issue is a bigger issue
ok 0
did you use ubuntu bold on the try it love it share it part yes i am 0
i did not edit it with krita as i wanted to be sure that i do n t break the
do n t hurt to say it thats the one i was searching nice 1
there s a ro project file there i have it not 100 sure if i want this design to be
because i wanted your confirmation that it s ok sure you do n t want an account 1
ooohh krita opens xcf files i am talking about all the proprietary drivers not nouveau i want to force enable
sorry i am not able to understand it s great that you are interested 0
i know that nouveau is the default driver for a fresh install but release upgrade last time when i upgraded
if you ve edited grub previously then ubiquity checks for changes t grub before it iinstalls a new unedited one
other then that time ok there it detects the driver 1
ok i installed to so the previously chosen driver was n t detected thanks 0
either way there should be talks and beer you are talking about the fresh install right 1
i was taking about upgrading from inside the current kubuntu install layer folders 0
you lol a lot when is the next stabilization update due for 15 04 0
you now have the ro disc art thanks lol 0
ya i too suspect that but i know you have heard many people telling you about the blank screen after

um yes sometimes it s not quite up to date with some newer nvidia gpus esopecially the higher end ones
i was in the shade seems so yes iirc gt 610 was a problem a while ago 1
it looks bad in ro on the disc label or restoring after reboot or startup 0
ok these gpu companies have to open there drivers may be then we will have a good experience with their
yes i am yesterday i saw the know bugs of 15 10 alpha for found that the ark issue is
there is was a bug in ubiquity and i had earlier spoke to shadeslayer about this i have been waiting
merci beaucoup i will give the bug id now 1
ok there it detects the driver that usually happens try starting the xserver with root permission 1
or you do it ok can you check for the bug i have given while you are testing 15 10
everything in the front on has a reason we need to do that in testing 1
what s pootle good night 1

well why idd you mark fixes i d like to submit a talk to linuxcon europe cloudopen europe they re
would you be able to help me craft a talk proposal i ve fixed the tests on that cloudstack mp
that part is the runcmd config job it can be regenerated by i ve fixed the tests on that cloudstack
may be helpful to say i m also doing this on hardware with append ds nocloud seedfrom var cloud init
thank you sir thanks a ton for that i ll look at my host and see what i have 0
i removed the base64 encoding but it still does n t set the hostname are you able to add all
would you be able to help me craft a talk proposal the other bug is actually about doing it every
someone just noted the security issue in the comments of that bug i ll look at backporting it tomorrow also
the release of that security fix in to wily running the command manually after the system is booted works without
runcmd stuff is run in 2 parts i had thought it was the cpc bug or something 0
thank you sir so the first part writes var lib cloud instance scripts runcmd from what it finds in user
i ve fixed the tests on that cloudstack mp thanks a ton for that i ll look at my host
i removed the base64 encoding but it still does n t set the hostname someone just noted the security issue
sure enough the runcmd file does n t exist runing cloud init single does n t generate it either now
default mixer for audio there really isnt a mixer like that though you can install and use pavucontrol any helop
alsamixer in the terminal is also handy yeah 0
and it s not problem with pulseaudio what music 1
i understand you now have xubuntu but when you reference before i dont know what that means i install it
sure so pavucontrol is not working for you friend alsamixer is in the terminal 0
ok please install and try pavucontrol before you were using xubuntu 15 04 and you liked what that was what
tray alsamixer is in the terminal 1
also you can use sudo apt get update sudo apt get install pavucontrol or just use pavucontrol 0
there s been some testing with mir but we do n t have any plans at the moment the team
this magic just happened without it in front of me its challenging for me to give specifics 1
what icon for pavucontrol how do i update my system 0
i will show man its in the menu pulse audio volume control 1
you got it there is no tray afaik 1
sure i understand that what im saying is the hardware is not supporting that out of the box the frightening
panels same icon as before what 1
when did you have what you want and when did that change will be xubuntu switched to mir and snappy
so before you installed xubuntu 15 04 you had something different correct what was that different thing that really kicks

so now it s out of my hands i believe yw 0
i guess that s a good real life test case though ahem yes it s now in qa s hands
yes the code is on silo 34 i checked the diff briefly and it looks good 1
bzoltan also said the uitk was having issues with the new gcc which is what i was pinging the desktop

he is up since he s online i crosscheck it mhall119 an apt cache policy could uncover few secrets around

not sure if related or not i do n t have anything against having it but i m in the
do i need to recreate the silo i doubt it has anything to do with my silo 1
as a quick check just revert unity plugin scopes that s the only package in the silo we should know
that s my bet but checking without the silo ah ok so i see in the merge you try to
you need to do a watch only build now right also happens without the silo package 1
approving the silo i guess that s a good real life test case though ahem 0
thanks it s fine for you too you re a core dev 0
but it s 1am usually sil is up by now what do we do with silo 15 1
can you park it for now but keep it in your queue with a caveat that it may need to
yes i know we should know soon i guess when it comes to landing of silo 24 1
you re welcome i plan to make a proper abandon job that does the right thing in all cases but
i do n t mean this merge here but the overall idea behind the strings https launchpad net distros ubuntu
just wait long enough and everything gets solved yes the code is on silo 34 1
it could affect any https connections even though i did n t get the upstream bug s site to do
same error after retrying thanks there were some odd reports re that on mailing list 1

yikes that last successful artifacts bit scared me for a sec made me think i accidentally published some unity8 silo
let me check that they did n t do anything arch related there yep that s just some jenkins bs

it eod is spain around 7 30 ah 0
you re welcome ah and modify your landing request to target the overlay 0
let me check that they did n t do anything arch related there you can top approve it then as
done heeeeey i have the usual request 0
as a quick check just revert unity plugin scopes that s the only package in the silo looking 1
if they re assigned you need to merge clean and check if not just edit the status to abandoned thanks

looking so to start with what version is your env 1

so to repro i d recommend using 1 20 if you can that is the idea yeah 0
do you see if 1 22 is reading machine x log and forwarding the content where if struct was not
agh ah i have another way 1
it was when rsyslog was enabled yes the only difference is that when a machine is removed the ipaddress is
much appreciated and you can trivially loop over that to create as much logspam as you want 1
thanks i ll try with that 0
if you review my pr i think my previous attempts failed because i was creating log lines that were too
so you need lots of short messages rather than few long ones so i did n t bother adding another
i need to check it ll fit through the 1 2 sieve at least log lines smaller than 1mb 1

i feel like we should have some coordination to find out when we can purge items from the txn collection
can you confirm if the patch would obviously apply to a 1 20 branch hmmm no it seems like only
did n t do anything glad you got it working and any thoughts on how we might test in as
yes the 1 20 code is pretty similar so would work there removing a machine marks associated ip addresses as
you re doing this on 1 22 right have you checked 1 24 master as well how s the file
cool ensure availability juju ssh 1 sudo stop rsyslog logspam on machine 0 until all machines log grows to 512mb
i thought 1 22 was the important one that s all i ve looked into so far afaik the others
i agree with that basic sentiment wes and alexis were supposed to meet last night to discuss official upgrade plans
from the bug i tried creating an ha env creating a giant machine 0 log and all machines log on
not sure why it was intermittently failing yeah i have n t had much luck with that either 0

there close enough ah gotcha so could we just pass in a few closures or an interface that handle the

it s cool and all but this is n t really the place to be advertising things it was like
yup bug please tzinfo is going to be the relevant package na that s no worries you wont be hearing
we just use the tzdata distro package for all tz data on the phone just file it against that no
well if desktop is correct and the overlay ppa doesnt have tzdata thats theoretically impossible where are you based 0
and your desktop install is vivid too and up to date with all updates then your sold and happy with

itym after 16 04 i e when installing packages it should n t be using lang c but e g
the unnecessary whitespace change in the init script is gross tabs versus spaces if that introduces a delta with debian
nice do i i thought that so long as 16 04 existed people might be upgrading from something older 1
ahh not just one package sorry has to wait i think one of us might be confused about the meaning
16 04 needs to have the upgrade code 16 10 doesn t 16 10 is after 16 04 in so
wtf similar whitespace changes in postinst too you re good at that 1
what does service libvirt bin stop do is that going to kill everyone s vms during the upgrade i do

slangasek responded on the list i ll respond again ack 1
and i m updating chroots anyway so no pressure to fix it asap as that ll invalidate the chroots by
you would have to call it fedora rhel do n t backport new versions just security fixes ok then you
why do you want to do that i m just venting 1
rhel point releases carry major architectural changes so you should read the release notes carefully i thought once upon a

and it says camera gallery which sounds like a really bad workaround i retried some of your ftbfs but i
anyway no need for a blame game we just need to wait yeah that was part of going through transitions
because someone does n t understand how dependencies work all right all righ ti ll do it 0

it s not called at boot it does n t apply the fonts unless someone calls it manually a package
ah i did n t look if they were themselves transitions ppas that aim to test things for the archive
ack on the flip side if things ca n t build in the release pocket that s a pretty serious
sort of bug 1484258 in vtk dicom ubuntu demote activiz net and friends to proposed from release undecided new https
unlike you ok will do that from now on 1
ah thanks yeah they only will stop being satisfiable once the transitinos land 1
yeah i added them this morning but removed them again as it s too unwieldy workaround to what 0
i usually just click through the package names on a transition page and ignore the ones which already have rebuilds
i started with test building but after i ran into the fourth package with a 3 h build time i

are you beige on http pad ubuntu com gcc 5 transition ok will look soon 1
did you see backscroll about gcc 5 and g 5 being ginormous due to unstripped binaries no hard to track

one more thing to break if i do it https bugs launchpad net ubuntu cdimage filebug 1
but ubuntu cdimage doesnt install any packages it only rolls bootable images out of existing components thanks for the heads
no if there s a higher version in proposed already the correct tool is remove package i ve added you
the majority of the packages actually we rebuilt more than half of them already but nitpicking i m looking at
yeah they only will stop being satisfiable once the transitinos land erm i would n t recommend that use wily
is plain c even in the list the majority compared to those already migrated 1
maybe add relevant ftbfs are tracked on http pad ubuntu com gcc 5 transition help with those is greatly appreciated
i m running a wily proposed desktop so at least there are no more transitions with things like src launchpad
all transitions that touch packages in the desktop need to be finished to get it all to migrate i m

lgtm now thanks ok i checked and libwrap is in main so it s just an inert build dep 0
infinity does this need extra attention 47 transitions done not bad for a day 0
this conversation might be a massive coc violation no one s arguing with you that defaults could and should be
is that intentional or a horrible bug nudged 1
right that s generally a good idea building dependencies first to speed up arm64 so please keep pinging 1
oh thats legacy crap that someone from the phone team needs to clean up oh there s a script for
what s broken in console setup good 0
by openvpn possibly ah thanks seems quite a regression from 4 9 0
fsvo better so two bugs there maybe three 1 livecd rootfs should probably have a saner default for people building
bug 1484101 yeah 1 will be part of my blanket s c c utf 8 across the world of buildds
trusty did n t have this issue because the older console setup version did n t care about lang i
even better victoria i m pretty sure a straight d i install with mini iso would do the same on
the iso contents of all releases after 14 04 that i saw had iso 8859 15 in filesystem squashfs you
btw if you have a support contract and you tell them you have n t run yum update to the
nah you get to pick which you want i take it from your argh that those are packages we want
maybe https launchpad net ubuntu source postbooks 4 7 0 3build1 build 7790500 too then then it depends on the
is plain c even in the list you re in vancouver right i could use a vacation on the coast
infinity fyi https wiki ubuntu com proposedmigration autopkgtestinfrastructure administration yeah i think it is 1
and 135mb for g 5 you mean that casper should reconfigure it on boot but why should it be broken
sdk libs libjsoncpp0v5 the point is that it doesnt matter whats in the rootfs the installer must reconfigure it properly
well the bug is in both console setup should n t necessarily have to go back and reconfigure itself just
i do n t think that s the problem well it should since the installer allows you to select a
it already does some amounts of magic to get you the correct etc default keyboard what should that be 0
so we re slowly converging on a world where most people think utf 8 is basically okay but you re
export c in live build auto build doesnt sound so clever setupcon has been broken in ubuntu for about 6
ah i have n t in general noticed arm64 being orders of magnitude slower than others if that s what
can you point those two out to doko when he wakes up so they do n t get lost in
they claim rhel 6 is a stable software distribution like say ubuntu 12 04 lts only the one i pointed
ok if you tell me which ones those are i ll look when i have a bit of time and
right none in bugzilla 1
in launchpad that would certainly do it 0
ack 1
retrying tests requires snakefruit ubuntu archive access that s a larger group i m pretty sure a straight d i
ubuntu archive should be a smaller group the largeness of it is a bug p i would n t say
oh now i get it so the problem is not in the packaging it s probably in the code that
should we do formal aa training and make you part of the team some day so you re not bypassing
build score that d be nice 1
cause you have literally carte blanche in the archive from that unix account which makes me uneasy as a community
i retried the vtk rebuilds but many of them still fail due to uninstallability sorry please ask sweetshark seb128 might
which one yeah conflicted with plumbers someone did n t plan that out well 1
maybe alternative would be making cableswig less strict but i do n t know if breaking that assumption would mess
ah i have n t in general noticed arm64 being orders of magnitude slower than others if that s what
sure arm64 lags just for resource reasons slower cpu than ppc fewer builders than everyone else very slow i o
anyway i ll keep poking at it must be something transient but yeah check tbb the build times are insanely
robru had noted yesterday that the previous successful build on arm64 before the buildd timeout was also long 4x the
yeah tres weird maybe i ll revive my carefactor later and throw a debugger or profiler at it for now
usr lib gcc linux gnu 5 lto1 and usr lib gcc linux gnu 5 cc1plus are both unstripped at least

you re in vancouver right i could use a vacation on the coast doko arguably a bug in the script
i would n t say no a bug report 0

this is now replaced by castxml good morning 0
i m trying to build activiz net which calls gccxml which now calls castxml then uses cableswig to consume the
unfortunately castxml seems to be writing slightly different xml than gccxml namely it s leaving off some name attributes cableswig
having castxml always write out a name attribute even if just name seems to get activiz net building just quickly
the private production branch only carrries lists or mail addresses nowadays afaik debian med packages are n t my expertise
asafp you mean take it out of the release pocket so it would n t block migrations 1
yeah looks like a sizeable bubble of packages but all in that debian med universe seemingly not terrible to demote
alternatively i could land a patch to castxml that inserts empty name attributes instead of leaving them off thanks 0
laney could you proof read this draft for u d a http paste ubuntu com 12061573 file a bug add
paperwork ok will chase exact list of rdeps so yeah a bit of growth there p 0

also is there a fancy way to get all recursive rdeps besides using reverse depends a bunch yep 0

though it ll take a good half hour to upload these chubby chroots we build our audit differently due to
ok i checked and libwrap is in main so it s just an inert build dep none near here maybe
ok then you can add the with libwrap and corresponding build depends back in but the disable listener delta needs
okay so as we just discussed up there for all of those the correct action is n t demote to
you also want to take a look at livecd rootfs that assembles the rootfses enumerating which is which would be
infinity right no need for it but also no need for a delta adding it back but of course leaving
nothing relevant for building i m endlessly tolerant everyone knows that 1
all packages demoted i m leaving it to you to close out the bug tasks now for servers and desktop

cool i ve no idea tbh we can probably find out but it s hitting late friday and folks will
hey services are kinda etherial 1
yea gotcha hmm there s an http server normally on local provider acting as storage it looks like there s

will the gui quickstart handle that good luck 1

curl http 10 0 3 1 8040 hangs doh thats possible localhost 1
running juju deploy under env u does n t help but perhaps it s jujud s environment that matters oh
just make like a data or payload directory or something in your charm thanks for the clues 1
well i ll see what i can do i d suggest mentioning a bit charms reactive to others when related
something similiar in it s readme it recommends that if you want to add rules to add an extra vcl

ahh i have found the file but i ca n t see the var value for the background image i
backgroundimagefile maybe it s something else in your configuration 0
dpkg get selections grep linux image nc termbin com 9999 just backgroundmode without value 1
oh heh i do n t know but i sadly would n t expect it okay this is my file
kdenlive same here but it also does not accept a background image via preferences 1
so for background via preferences you have background image what xubuntu version do you have if i open a terminal
so it s all fairly fresh hmmm i have the exact same versions 1
xfconf query l does not list xfce4 terminal either is that also a bug or do i need to invoke
does n t show on mine either that ll return a url paste here 0
so apparently to only way to change xfce4 terminal behavior is through the config file how you doing cfhowlett how
but apparently the preferences override the config file its what you said 0
mine is located in etc xdg xdg xubuntu xfce4 terminal terminalrc 0
ahhh hello i need some help 0
how you doing cfhowlett how s it going over there that makes sense 1

that seems like it s an easy way to run into test pollution to me omw 0
i might call it something like initializecontainers then but maybe not not a big deal i think you should really

i ve been following your branches last week have n t tried any of it yet but it looks great
no thats a zonk d btw do you know why no deploy in the last two weeks staging seems fine
good work though plays well i think the webops team had lots of other stuff to get done as well
i m trying to wrap my head about how the logic has changed when i try the branch in its
yeah that s the problem i m still trying to fix and the bit above that which defines 0
hmm where do imported docs end up not sure about that you still need cross compilers in the sdk click
sorry not end up but get published great might be worth forcing portrait orientation as well as the landscape mode
good question oh 0
i ve seen them do you have any merges you would like a review on hmm me looks 1
it s bizarre in the page tree it looks like snappy guides devel went into the top level but its

why do you need to recompile btw cant you just use the binaries from eth archive ty unrelated but i
or it errors on placeholder 0 index out of range is it in the store 0
not impossible that i am mixing the sb2 with it what was a different beast maybe we ca n t
well thats it 0
i ve frequently seen pages having two instances one for live one for draft that could be related to what

ahah for sure just wanted to know if you encountered that and have some tips for me sure but then
cool well the list is dynamic though 1
is it in the store just to know what listmodel will think of that role 1
i am cross packaging with cowbuilder i guess it ll be an array then 1
so no wonder it creates listmodel out of it instead of listmodel you meant having a static listelement in that
yeah oh wow i havent been afk for awhile should prolly change that nick now 0
thank you the list item swipe thing irc message from couple days back probably i m looking into some unrelated

multi arch support using cmake the problem is how our builders work to build a cmake project cmake is running
haha p multi arch as in fat packaging 1
yes armhf i386 amd64 in one click pak it is very useful for building 0
ok so what is your plan the reboot version works will with the sdk but failed with this script 0
however if you want a automated solution this is what the sdk does i guess it slipped the last release
there s a bash script which can build fat click pack http paste ubuntu com 11930209 good question 0
yeah thats what the sdk does as well with qmake good question 0
hi the reboot version works will with the sdk but failed with this script 1
whats the error its not only about executing armhf apps on x86 how about 3d acceleration afaik qemu does not
gtg i did n t test this cos i have only armhf chroot popey said he built an big amd64
got the branch link handy i changed a few things for example not recreating articles every time and being able
reason i ran into problems is because there doesn t seem to be a pascal cross compiler https adoptingubuntu wordpress
i ll move over to the office and have a look at it as well lp mrqtros ubuntu rssreader app
line 17 ah yeah thats a project issue then 1
well the builddir is not the problem the installdir is thats one of the few packages we miss for that
why do you make me read cmake files d is it all done in qt 0
seems i just need to know how to make the click generate a script to execute multi arch if you
why do you need to recompile btw cant you just use the binaries from eth archive i ll open a
no your project setup it wrong it d be bizarre if that made it work but it d be worth
as read from u1db binaries under lib bin 1
could u show an example cmake file yeah got it 0
you have the ubuntu sdk handy right now maybe it s make sense to try to find out the parent
it is one i used on an old hacked zxspectrum gb emulator http bazaar launchpad net notes app dev reminders
the reminders app is using you around a bit later 1
were ther ever any plans to use qemu arm static for sdk builds rather than the current click chroot setup
ok i ll poke around and see if i can get any further as read from u1db 0
yeah see the lines in the linked cmakelists txt a ton of cached changes suddenly just appeared in my pages
i m looking into some unrelated changes right now popey you need no script to execute the right file on
multi arch support using cmake no i mean the desktop file can only point to one executable file but there
seems i just need to know how to make the click generate a script to execute multi arch so i
you desktop file should point to nameofbinarywithoutanypath and it will all work magically why do you make me read cmake
meizu or bq lol 1
popey so all binary parts of the application go into that directory lib executables go into the bin subdir qml
that sounds like slooooooooooooooow apps binaries under lib bin 0
maybe might bring amd64 down to arm speeds btw do you know why no deploy in the last two weeks
haha p you have n t experienced magic until you have used qemu static 1
haha p its not only about executing armhf apps on x86 how about 3d acceleration afaik qemu does not support
multi arch support using cmake yes might be a problem i ca n t quite work out at what level
not sure about that you still need cross compilers in the sdk click chroots where does that leave graphics acceleration
the problem is how our builders work to build a cmake project cmake is running inside the chroot it is
so you d need a full system emulation environment for that i remember that u said there s a script
ok i think i found the issue i had hoped qemu arm static had solved all my cross compiling worries
brilliant cheers yeah urls are independent of the actual cms tree 0
were ther ever any plans to use qemu arm static for sdk builds rather than the current click chroot setup
i think the click chroot execution actually uses it as backend two subsequent calls to the same thing give me
it s bizarre in the page tree it looks like snappy guides devel went into the top level but its
which is why i found qemu arm static in the first place i know this was the initil design that
it d be bizarre if that made it work but it d be worth a try and it d be
there are std folders for that aah i did n t think there was any emulation going on in the
whats the error reason i ran into problems is because there doesn t seem to be a pascal cross compiler
ok there is a fpc build on armhf just not a cross compiler 1
nemo is keen to port hedgewars which is pascal not sure about that you still need cross compilers in the
the armhf click chroot is an x86 chroot with armhf dev packages and cross compiler i m no expert but
so your is fine ah so no qemu involved at all 1
no that uses sdl1 2 multi arch as in fat packaging 0
it does n t like it p the click is not depending on qemu user static 1
the code use sdl2 but the deb build is on 1 2 haha p 0
yeah got it as per https code launchpad net vthompson ubuntu weather app reboot remove cpp flag merge 267437 this
yes and then you will have problems finding actually one that has 3d drivers scratchbox is doing that 1
and in my cached tree there is a version of my tests that put everything in the right place i
ooh that looks good where does that leave graphics acceleration 0
i am not sure if i remember right 4 6y but as i remember sb used both system and user
thanks for your persistence for me the pbuilder based builders were the most reliable and least troublesome tools with building
just to know what listmodel will think of that role well when i researched it user didnt exist 1
i use cowbuilder dist wily armhf create and then just send it the dsc files all logs and results go
not impossible that i am mixing the sb2 with it what was a different beast apart from that it all
well the builddir is not the problem the installdir is ah i think i know what i was doing wrong
i think mono is still not installable in an armhf chroot today so i should be able to get any
multi arch as in fat packaging yay 1
fixed thanks i like magic 0

not sure what s going on on the langpack o matic side of things on the people u c location

what about the priority should glib be bumped to 1600 or something bumped priorities for glib20 on vivid and wily

yeah i would have assumed it would just skip if it does n t know what to do with it
i acknowledge what you are saying but instead the complete profile file seems missing 1
right it would fail to generate the profile in this case 1
but there is no concept of point releases for this or for snappy it skips the profile not the policy
one you are correct people have to upgrade to ota 5 and there is no way for an app developer
and do you like it do the normal features work we do have a plan to fix this in apparmor
i m not sure what this you are referring to you mean if an abstraction is missing keep on going
yes but more than that to be able to deal with new rule types etc that are not understood iirc

yes that is exactly my thinking bug 1386241 in system config printer ubuntu trusty add the full ipp everywhere support
i think you should talk to them first blah 0
yeah i know but it s not very accessible imo if you have large menus like that of gimp it
did you change timezones icons in menus 1
there s a bug at least i consider it that in gtkaction that produces imagemenuitems even on menubars by default
shrug i think it does that always has icons 1
same to you welcome back hm there s another i thought there was only menuimages 1
just incase i have reviews that need work or motu application stuff icons from gmenumodel are always shown the docs
we should update trusty to 4 2 8 i just send you package link and details by email right so
should be done there imhp or it was actually fallout from the ubuntu session split dropping depends i guess 1
the thing that s usually less reproducible is test failures as they are sometimes sensitive to the environment cpu speed
not yet and i ll go back to work and not logout ever now 0
ah i did that in the status files on britney but painful 0
yeah sometimes mostly for gcc and similar as otherwise they d be stuck forever debian did that 0

i probably wo n t be able to respond to any emails from tomorrow till the 24th or ual or
oh interesting i did n t know that i thought it was ual we should update trusty to 4 2
so yes then i suppose upstart bin should grow at least a recommends cgmanager the it s friday 0
i believe the fix required some nux changes and we sort of like to tiptoe around doing that but aside
glad its friday i do n t know it s not using gtk so not getting that for free some
the package should go in with the sru of cups filters i do not know whether i have donme all
how did you fix it i have also withdrawn the s c p package of this sru earlier to do

many thanks for helping me with that what s the current status wrt image builds can we accept the fixed
the point of the ini style bits is so we can guess if a user removed one of your packages
go to be better than what i ve just seen i just upgrade ubuntu mate 15 04 to 15 10
oh the removal blacklist p boo 0
you do n t need that in an explicit blacklist if you already list it in metapkgs just give me
in which case it s a lightdm issue if it does n t oh see i say that but most
you want me to bump the standards in debian control ah it s proposed 0
can i tweak the seeds to ensure ubuntu mate core does remain installed if you go through the policy upgrade
mmm after a standards bump to 3 9 6 lintian complians about one less thing that before 1

says it does it with paypal so do i need to have the money in a paypal account are you
payment is done though paypal but i have the money in google wallet yes 1
it worked i have no idea 1
oh well try paypal or your bank i guess could you shot me the link to the developer ubuntu launchpad

that s not the proposal i remember from yesterday do i need also an egl build with mir support 0
yeah it s because of the drivers is the define a better way 0
they are pulled by the seeds maybe it just uses egl to get a gl context 0
or rather mine plus a bunch of other things to make it pass ci i presume the issue is different
the assumption that cursors have contiguous buffers is spread over a lot of our code https code launchpad net alan

yeah it looks like it using egl to get a gl context i ve missed this error msg libegl warning

you can make the exec in the desktop file point to an exe wrapper hey folks i was able to

i will check wihtout the export to check if that is the real reason 1
without that is gives the same errors as before error build mir mefzij mir 0 16 0 15 10 20150921

same error as before opengl related yes 0
not worth blocking http paste ubuntu com 12558073 1
well the mir connection is glfw3 doing you can only have opengl or glesv2 or glesv1 0
i also do that with cocos2d to get the display parameters i guess so with ldd i see the deps
o open the mir sever you could try to run a glfw3 example to make sure glfw3 is working on
opt click ubuntu com hexpuzzle 0 1 bin hexpuzzle error while loading shared libraries libglfw so 3 can not open
it is i have checked probably it does not check the lib path 1
you can force the path with export in the sh do you want to leave lp alan griffiths mir fix
ok i think egl gets somehow initialized later and not with gles but lets ignore that 0
will check my sh is it correct http paste ubuntu com 12558221 1
if it still fails we ll have to use strace to check where its looking for the lib right which
it is ok i will continue myself because u did more than enough building glfw 0
i will ask you when i get really stucked nice soo hmm now why 0

standup ho heh then i m afraid i must direct you back to the mongo operator reference i m sure

doing horrible things to ourself is much more justifiable thann doing horrible things to our external clients thanks which hangout
that s the discussion around the ticket i m looking at at least we understand the scope of the pain

please just make a new version of the endpoint that does the right thing when you re working please see
no i guess i ll just keep the old behaviour i was sort of afaid of that 0
hi could you please take a look at http reviews vapour ws r 2633 it s proposed against a feature
and that addr was not a valid value it means duplicating all the code 1
it s a cure worse than the ill awesome 0
possibly stale versus we actually know this is wrong so we basically can t version http endpoints that feels like
because there is no error code in this case i m saying that providing a new version of an endpoint
do you agree that changing the internal errors that will never happen in practice is ok bug 1328129 changed panic
that seems mainly to point to a failure to separate the behaviour from the transport one would think that a

does that ring any bells if you do n t mind changing error messages this is essentially just changing the
hey ho we endure because there is no error code in this case 1
i see it as the format at the moment the error generation is not tied to the request 0
if a client is reading it as a textual error message then json is just the text could you please

by any chance would you know how i can get a hold of the packaging script of juju mongodb my
heh ok so that assert triggers dammit so this is a valid assert but suffers from the same problem so
and if there is a certainty out there it is that you will need to change your apis adding an

externalising the costs by making secret api changes is not really ok though it does try a lot 0
yup i think there is room for pragmatism here 1
would probably be clearer and if there is a certainty out there it is that you will need to change
stealing all those jobs from real americans my perception is that the last 3 times you ve convinced me of
for an api that is just getting a file i m not sure you can set it afterwards 0
particularly when the api is inconsistent already sometimes returning json sometimes not with no way for the client to know
so it s not even that i do n t trust you i do n t trust myself or anybody
all data is always stale anyway eight or nine times bitten spanish inquisition times shy 1
oh one other thing you think that changing error codes is breakage my code adds error code returns where previously
that is now the error code will actually reflect the error if we change this and there s a client
yes it s clearly a change in behaviour new version please and none of those errors have any test coverage
great if you ask for v2 you can be sure you ll get an error code 1
v1 maybe maybe not do you feel lucky p grep 0
i think there is room for pragmatism here ok another question then how should we determine api version 1
i was sort of afaid of that at the moment i think my tendency is towards declaring it a request
i have a mild preference for doing it in the url in general but in all these cases we have
i m not keen on the approach we ve used elsewhere with the version as part of the url path
yes yep i m in the hangout 0
deterministically it seems stable urls and varying headers seem sane then 1
do you think i should just copy the whole apiserver directory if i m copying the handler code i might
no you got most of them p 0
so version based if statements scattering the code you can set it afterwards 0
should it not just be a few maps of versions to handlers i suck 0
yer first check the version then dispatch to the appropriate handler 1
we ll need to combine your branch with the version bump to get the landing allowed if i m copying
and machine 0 to check any server side changes honestly i m thinking it s not worth fixing 1

at the moment the error generation is not tied to the request juju set env logging config juju debug 0
grep f 1 24 cmd juju go so after the transaction that same query finds the machine 1
certainly not the assert does see the result of earlier txn op in the same transaction does n t it
almost all our state types are now very short lived one api call and that s it ah ha this
something to do with nil values and the api that got cleaned up certainly not 1
so extend the or i m not keen on the approach we ve used elsewhere with the version as part
no ca n t that s kind of the point especially given the marginal cost of a version change 0
needs to be done as a separate transaction then bzr branch ubuntu juju mongodb 0
we have an interesting race because of fallback scopes sorry my brain was still tangled with the write on get
so sorry i did n t make connection before in this case i think you probably just want to check
i certainly ca n t so sorry i did n t make connection before 1
ok should it not just be a few maps of versions to handlers 0
it s better not to do it as a separate transaction as the first one could succeed then the second
our meeting conflicts with the juju core meeting want to move to after our 9am and if they ve changed
my aim is to remain backwardly compatible and not to require clients to fetch environments uuid charms v2 or whatever
we have an interesting race because of fallback scopes i m thinking of adding an error code field to some
if setprovideraddresses and setmachineaddreses are set concurrently which is highly likely ping 0
the first time neither preferredaddress will be public nor private fair enough although then it would seem that refresh is
yes i m talking about adding fields to a response 1
it s less harmful for sure but is n t it better for the client that might use the extra
your lateness stands not necessarily 1
state itself should be but most of the stuff you get from a state will not be if the field
403 forbidden seems close i understood you but you ca n t do that right but what actually happens is
should it not just be a few maps of versions to handlers ha one problem with doing the version in
ha good point that said the value of that approach is certainly diminished it came from a time when everything
honestly i m thinking it s not worth fixing see i m shit at predicting these subtle breaks 1
would probably be clearer i m thinking of adding an error code field to some responses where there is none
yeah that sounds like a great thing but a new api version to me cheers 0
i ll try later and i kinda have to stop now 1
one way to get around that issue is to include the api version with the response you can set it
https github com juju juju blob master worker uniter hook hook go l24 it s taken from juju charms and
but interesting ok but where do we actually determine which hooks for a given charm should be run 1
are you blocked on that metric spool error i mean where is the information that validate is check set 1

i looking for the code that actually generates the list of hooks it has a value field which is really

depends on whether you also add ratings the stable phone images will switch over to the 15 04 framework only
as a developer if you want to target users with the aquaris e4 5 which runs the stable images you
i did n t know what s up but i ran ci manually for your u1db qt branch and then
did you see my comments too hard to say but the current focus is to get 15 04 stable and

so url dispatcher would expect sthing like appid url define power 0
nik90 we should also get renatu in on this converation he had some opinions on this yesterday or do we
how do we then know which app to open and what happens if you reorder things 0
well the thing is url dispatcher needs appid as protocol yeah 0
exactly unless i am mistaken 0
yes confirming x canonical activation url is the x prop to use as far as charles specified it can be
its complicated is probably the best answer true but if there are multiple apps registering for alarm url prefix then
and the cla is n t particularly obnoxious if you read it right but then any app can override the
renatu has a patch at https code launchpad net renatofilho qtorganizer5 eds fix 1426519 merge 253985 to generate x prop
yes i am making the changes on alarm based on that nik90 renatu it would be too ugly if the
hey tushard welcome the idea here is to allow alarms created by app 1 to be opened by only app
my opinion is that if the app create the event alarm and it is a app especific thing then the
at l80 those ones need 1gu cool 1
thanks balloons for the reviews if we use the standard alarm then app 1 could get app 2 s alarms
huh why i see some rational in renatu s idea because then it would be easier to replace clock app
the thing is that you will get the second part of the url without the protocol so it s up
renatu nik90 the question is should n t we support the ability for multiple apps to create their own alarms
right as i wrote https code launchpad net charlesk indicator datetime lp 1426519 add tag for menuitem activation url merge
the question is what to do about the exception you mentioned if you want the alarms created by the clock
so then such as hehe 0
if you can not remove how do you override qml clock error saving alarm code 2 0
well if we go with a generic alarm protocol deleting a 3rd party app would n t affect the user
but wo decided which app to open in case you install a 3rd party clock app i have to import
regarding tempfile http paste ubuntu com 10677461 will i get that dialog each time it is invoked that d suck
i m working primarily on the music app you can set the default one 1
i understand that and it sounds right the problem is that it feel the app developer to provide the protocol
we can define that alarm is the default value the devel can chage it to the app id if he
well the idea was to let several apps to be able to create alarms individually and i do no tmean
done will the alarms created on others app visible on clock app 1
http www cplusplus com forum beginner 1304 no clock app should only see clock alarms they should never collide 1
this way it would make sense for alternative clock app as well renatu all this boils down to one question
ok and in order to work with 15 04 i would have to erase my device or can i switch
but i think the way gmusicbrowser implements it is the best whell if they still using qtorganizer you can have
not sure i agree to that since seeing the reminder s app alarms in the clock app would look strange
i m not sure why you d want to keep alarms under a separate sources note that it s not
the alarm api can filter the alarms based on the application thats what you are trying to do 0
so url dispatcher would expect sthing like appid url security d you can block apps to access different sources 1
i filter alarms based on collection what about crashes 0
so far i use only one collection for all alarms sdk launcher installing the application failed 0
with the new changes on qtorganizer the calendar app will be able to replace the event url though to contribute
current work and we need to have some fallback url in case of events synced from google etc 1
yes maybe i should have used alarms or reminders as the example there bug 1436110 in ubuntu music app music
so alarm alarm id which the corresponding app can get and open the correct alarm the question is what to
erm i think alarmid shoudl be sufficient anyway my 2 cents is that apps creating alarms should use the same
as far as charles specified it can be anything charles wil only call that url given in the x detail
you need to register this on url handler for your app btw popovers vs orientationhelper 0
alarms is comin bah it ran them in the wrong order 0
i m setting modes for common games renatu does the key need to be all capitals 1

awesome thnx yeah a good reason to not contribute to anything canonical does p 0
i updated to 15 04 but i still get warning root signature check failed but installing anyway as requested output
wrong framework hey what s the planned eta for the uitk vivid update just curious 0
that s what the qtcreator atm is setting for new projects in vivid but i m also trying to convince
atm there are only two 15 04 frameworks listed by qtc which are ubuntu core 15 04 and ubuntu core
so url dispatcher would expect sthing like appid url hmm i dont see ubuntu sdk 15 04 on my brand
then reminder will be reminder reminder id no that s not what me and popey are referring to 1
open manifest json file in qtc math round math random 0
considering that the use case where multiple apps register for the same url prefix is something that s going to
since we have to handle imported calendar events too datetime will still have to have a fallback url to handle
same result yes 0
you can absolutely inspect all the code and contribute fixes but canonical create and curate the code of the operating

should i use b2qt wifimanager thats how it is 1
not in the pastebin you gave me the question is what to do about the exception you mentioned 0
in the framework field there is only ubuntu core 15 04 and dev1 version listed so does that work 1
qml clock error saving alarm code 2 are the numbered buttons now right though 1
like the items in your row at l56 need the same width set yep 0
until you reset it at l80 those ones need 1gu 1
the coin flip is not working atm no code behind it at l189 those need 1gu 1
you probably need to put the math round around your math random what does that look like 1
so some of them are correct lol oh 0
i wonder why the ci did n t autotrigger itself when it was changed so l62 l69 l75 should read
then all the number ones should be units gu 2 not 1 because we wo n t be handling it
the weird thing is that the last line in get still has a valid alarm pointer but once reaches qml

i want to contribute to an already existing projects preferably tears literally in my eyes i was so happy do

i think it mostly depends on what you want to learn then are you talking about ubuntu device apps only

well the plan is eventually to do it in the sound indicator awesome thnx 0
with the new changes on qtorganizer the calendar app will be able to replace the event url but i m
clock app can not be removed basically we are waiting for one platform feature before this can work 1
because we wo n t be handling it the platform will or we will have to give it a preshuffled
basically it may change and probably will either be a precomputed random list or the random maybe more intelligent no
http imgur com a ajo6j no at the moment we handle the shuffling as our app is never suspended when
checking charles comments on teh bug i think we should decide what to place in the url at the moment
did somebody disable ci again staging has flake8 errors is that clear enough lol 1

you can rebuild the kernels yourself or wait for the newer ones for example the problem seems fixed in v4
if there are specific older builds you wanted they can be re queued but new ones be ok apw yep
soul survivor is the last temptation had the same issue but i m only after the latest lts 4 1
in theory it is fixed i ve re queued that build above we shall see if it pops out happy

looks like it uses network manager which i m not using try to find a bootable usb live stick and
ah okay only practical solution is to make it your main install 0
what am i looking on that file if it works maybe i can look into its source to figure out
hola timing between what 1
it s the freaking intel card 1
it already works with manually associating and then using dhclient the problem is that why do i have to use
no point doing that did you run the above already what card do you have yeah obviously you doing it
and after hilarious name 1
i ve dual booted windows 7 and older ubuntu before but i had a friend helping then as well because

and i never set a root password so i ca n t use su do all your experiments in a
heyy you messed with it how are we supposed to know what you did with it 1
install it yourself repeatedly using unetbootin is different from messing around with fdisk as you meantioned before 1

i need rest whenever ubuntu changes version i am in trouble you do n t read it anyway 1
well the drive is technically 3 64tb none of them worked 0
i do then i keep thinking to myself again optimus setups mostly do n t let you switch permanently like

what getting another error now 1
we re already in the 60 s so there s no point considering only 32 try it it should n

ok bye qengho what about a lenovo t450s in that comparison 1
thanks larsu thanks for that intel on cjwatson 1
qengho t450s with i7 and 20gb ram would be my choice if i had to buy a new workhorse tomorrow
careful oom killer coming your way https github com libreoffice core blob master mk l166 good pitti you 0
you re not maintaining any of the scopes k 0
that s because gnupg is part of the base devel package set i guess and ubuntu wishes to use gnupg2
i m off tomorrow and friday and monday i like the idea of getting debian to change too i think
clearly we need tuesday news as well hrm that s weird maybe ubuntu is behind somewhere 1
yes but in a hangout right now and they do n t matter anymore 0
then i bzr rm the moved files only ok now just need to finish the morning s bug triage and
sure sometimes corrupt means invisible 0
ok what s the best hardware setup in the absence of a slimport cable and bluetooth mouse frankly the normal
if everything crashes like that it s possible you ve broken an abi but forgot to bump it rc proposed
i m just sshing into my nexus 4 and running xmir from one connection and the apps from another i
oh so you use wily nice thanks to you too 0
sorry forgot dist upgrade never upgrades the dist for mir i mean 0
usually when theres a moved file you just need to pick one yeah worst name eva 1
right but the gtk app ca n t set that as the surface buffer you know wily works on mako
do you think it s worth trying we do n t need wily specifically looks like i have mir 0
so long as your vivid ends up with mir 0 15 it s not necessary ok i guess i ll
before i downgrade mako for this should i use arale instead i can at least use a mouse on arale
ba baw yeah 0 14 is soon going to be two releases behind i guess the overlay s not updated
basically any arm hardware is a useful dev platform to start tackling these issues or does that only return a
this is probably the wrong channel try ubuntu desktop although that s probably not the best one either you really
try it on wily can dri3bufferfrompixmap not be used to do server side allocation 0
it requires less communication with the client to get good behaviour the git branch of xmir 1
lp xmir team xorg server git xmir intel driver had some problems with it at some point 0
if everything crashes like that it s possible you ve broken an abi but forgot to bump it so glamor
https code launchpad net mir team mir attestable timestamps client merge 270470 but nothing seems to have crashed all the
is that the major downside of letting the client do it a bad client might starve the buffers well extra
how can mir solve the texture format issues as far as i can tell they are in the opengl layer
aye and multistrap works with phone overlay o so zenity works on desktop i assume 1
substitute where you install to and i think you have to delete the existing installed directory yes 1
it s just related work not a complete solution mir 0 15 adds a new function to choose pixel formats
right the problems are in the glamor layer i e xmir is not picking the formats i ll be eod
somehow moved files got added to my mp i dont remember adding it also it s almost obvious glamor is
what s the magic for running xmir so as to avoid thx 0
hand on my phone just resarted okey thanks 0
always rootless right it s somewhat opposed philosophically 0
no never rootless hand on my phone just resarted 0
ok i ve made a start thanks need to run to the post office and grab lunch too or does
oh ho eglflash and apparently only eglflash dies with a segfault on exit ok cool 1
i m particularly annoyed by server side allocation fyi i just tried backporting all the glamor changes from master and
so glamor provides dri3 by default but we ve disabled that and copied over the dri2 code ok cool 0
last i heard it was due to buffer allocation can dri3bufferfrompixmap not be used to do server side allocation 1
you know wily works on mako in the devel proposed channel just some bugs to contend with we ca n
iirc you need to poke around the jenkins job definitions to find it and since i ca n t get
no but it would be wrapped up in libmirclient right 0
so long as your vivid ends up with mir 0 15 it s not necessary so what is the client
so the nbs is that clients have a direct handle on their buffers as it currently stands they still call
and that only works on the desktop drivers not necessarily 0
ok i ve made a start thanks need to run to the post office and grab lunch too i m
i e a gtk app running inside mir can happily grab buffers from the intel driver ok thanks i think
as long as the client has n t gone rogue and is no longer listening to messages from the server
i m sanity checking on desktop first but it would be wrapped up in libmirclient right 1
i realized i wrote the wrong name on the package it sould be unity8 lxc thanks again heading off now
have a fine evening basically any arm hardware is a useful dev platform to start tackling these issues 0
i know but i thought as it s a mir related question i d ask here do you see this
right which i resolved i ll try 0
actually i do have a bluetooth apple magic trackpad just never succeeded in pairing it to a phone haha hmm
i wonder if the moved files were being re generated try it on wily 0
well i merged the server branch into a fresh mir branch any optimisation the server might want can be done
so i guess we need to wait to see the result of that before doing much frankly the normal way
i know bzr better and then some hand written trivial gtk apps 0
there are a bunch of optimisations you can do with it cool ill just make a comment on the branch
is danger 5 really a thing in australia i m not entirely sure that you ll be able to escape
yes c std string abi issues 1
nice thanks to you too cross compile chroot sh d vivid fixes that 1
well not if you then go and selsect 5 somehow moved files got added to my mp i dont remember
btw it s changed names you should pull from lp mir sure 0
i ve just been using the stable image and dist upgrading then building the git branch of xmir on the
then i bzr rm the moved files only ah ok then try ubuntu unity 1
well extra datapoint it does n t happen to other branches right and you are right on time usually they
iirc you need to poke around the jenkins job definitions to find it and since i ca n t get
but nothing seems to have crashed all the tests run to completion no 1
should n t we instead keep the import with playlist at 5 7 or just plain only export as 5
is it an actual regression for us or just a test issue read the e mail more carefully 1
yeah my brain hurt too when i was thinking what i needed to unpack diff and how so the first
let me look after that ah ack 1
so if comparing proper upstream version to jim s changes from vivid drops revision 1 and drops since 5 7
ack tsdgeos so the history appears when first time tap on it 0
been there tried that yeah my brain hurt too when i was thinking what i needed to unpack diff and
so in any case with the silo upload we need to import 5 7 to be able to use playlist
lol not really sure the hack patch seems to remove the 5 7 s so maybe 5 6 i think
yeah lol 0
s interesting i have it passing in xenial and failing in vivid o d 1
and unfortunately we do n t have that many designers around we had some building issues with the toolkit not
yeah i m actually using the unity8 greeter on my xenial box is it an actual regression for us or
zsombi they should understand the issue at least 1
anyhow this is an ux change so this needs to be talked with them zsombi tsdgeos the ubuntu ui toolkit
yeah but it s not there in xenial where are we with the slim greeter branch 0
you kind of are they re in autopkgtests for unity8 but we have another failure there which means it s
and unfortunately we do n t have that many designers around it s like it did n t get published
very much possible k let me create a simpler example for evaluation 0
can you hear us mup is on xmass holiday already d 1
zsombi zsombi we ve got a possible regression with that latest sdk https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source ubuntu ui
tsdgeos so the history appears when first time tap on it really 0
1 3 1778 15 04 20151217 1 0ubuntu1 vs 1 3 1761 16 04 20151216 1 0ubuntu1 behaviour change 1
let me look after that brilliant the description was n t pretty clear again 1
excellent can you hear us 0
the new direction from ux is that popups shoudl steal the focus so i leave the final word to jim
and unfortunately we do n t have that many designers around but afair the packaging issue has been fixed 0
tsdgeos do you have any tests for this anyhow this is an ux change so this needs to be talked
we just need a sdk provided history dropdown for the text field that works as design expected tsdgeos would you
so if comparing proper upstream version to jim s changes from vivid drops revision 1 and drops since 5 7

due to the switch from xscreensaver to light locker some users might have issues with timing of locking removing xscreensaver
so yeah go ahead and replace light locker with xscreensaver or something else but this is a fixable problem no
please read http xubuntu org news screen locking in xubuntu 14 04 good find 1
dude read the link it is not that important but loosing ability to run screen saver is not a good

nfs is very particular about permissions i notice fstab has rw option but your command line doesn t tmaybe that
read only or read write i think read write will be the default unless the nfs server has made it

seems like a copy up issue as it is failing in open opening it for write if i am reading
to the maintainers of overlayfs in the first instance as in whats in maintainers for fs overlay and thanks for
right so i ll change the ltsp code so that it does n t use truncate but the bug still
seems like a copy up issue as it is failing in open opening it for write if i am reading
so let it go looking into that 1
it fails for 2200m it succeeds for 2000m but it takes a very long time to truncate it like it
i think it was literally the least i could do considering the rapid turnaround it is absolutly copying it up
presumably failing at 2g i think it s miklos but i do n t see his name in overlay txt
i might the problem is not truncate but the fact to use it you have to open the file 1
right though at the time we open it all we are saying is open this so i can scribble on
to miklos cc linux unionfs sounds bad 0
i also see someone has worked up a fix for the fundamental issue though if you can avoid the copy
hmm so when i want to empty some files truncate s 0 is n t really an efficient way to
pa means easy support for smartcards and other devices withou hackish scripts ack thank you 1
i thought the truncate function would special case 0 there i am blank remind me 1
you signed off a couple of recent package uploads i was wondering if you re semi maintaining it right i
presumably failing at 2g i work with luks dm crypt cryptsetup extensively and there are a couple of related issues
got a fix in cryptroot expands the existing warning recommends a pass phrase and does n t return an error
got a fix in cryptroot expands the existing warning recommends a pass phrase and does n t return an error
getting the required support into systemd cryptsetup is going to be a big job upstream wants to use the kernel
ack thank you you do n t want to do it like that 1
systemd cryptsetup does support finding loading the keyfile directly however so if it does n t require any special steps
i think i just merged it so if you want to change it thats all good systemd cryptsetup complains about
currently the cryptsetup initramfs hook script knows its a problem and will report cryptsetup warning target uses a key file
that does n t help the user though i m wondering if we should n t have the script simply
you mean we are keying off that command line option to work out what file to put in the initrd
brainer but systemd tells us to get rid of it 1
we re keying off the crypttab entry for the container and not installing cryptsetup at all if there is a
to miklos cc linux unionfs systemd cryptsetup complains each time it sees keyscript which could lead to users like me
that it fails on 2g is broken but it will always be so i tend to agree if we know
so we ll keep an eye on that in case we find other side effects until overlayfs is fixed upstream
still though very nice it can be over ridden in crypttab using the initramfs option but its not obvious 1
the hook script does n t know if the luks slots may also contain a passphrase which the user can
whatever is hard for everyone i am sure so we ll keep an eye on that in case we find
makes sense but a lot of work cheers thanks you too 0

should get will to install the theme on the demo device for mwc though will look much better with it
that is why i am asking my question this way to try to find a good alternative for my device
you can find the full list of devices official images community images and works in progress at https wiki ubuntu
anyway rtm proposed is already smoother then devel p well you ask in a ubuntu channel what do you expect
ah well if you want to be able to run non android os you might want to buy a device

where was the folder where all the upstart job is where i removed ubuntu locate service seems related but i
we used that mainly to reliably reproduce it i wonder could you wait 10 minutes and see if network comes
sure can do yesterday it was like that for an hour or so but i ll watch more closely next
thanks and syslog should tell you what nm is doing thanks i ll watch out for that 0
i can not see your entire message ah so switching between 2g and 3g should trigger this 1
maybe but if it s the same bug then the connection should come back which it is n t well
i ve the same problem on krillin vivid but in my case the route is gone ok i wiil check
yeah i have no routes or up interfaces left awesome thank you 0
no replies afaik only special system services can continue processing while screen is locked 0

and for testing i added a 30secs pause between adding and machine removal pong 1
feeling better today good for work but not for hangout but getting closer with the test problem assigning a new
nothing should just remove ips without releasing them the machine removal just triggers set to dead wondered like you yesterday
i m glad you re feeling better sorry iu have two email with your name first i had to make
now simply created a 0 1 2 10 and added it to the 1st machine initialized in setup it funnily
i do n t see your worker implementing setup where it should start the watcher hmm this feels like the
thanks thankfully our job allows to work below a blanket ok to delay 10m to wait for perrito666 0
okay i m just finishing some stuff for will probably get to it around 11am the change comes later but
indeed it is installing packafes seems to be taking longer yeah 1
yep that s why we added them not quite sure i follow you please describe the steps when the event
axw i am back thanks d imho the state watchipaddresses should react on state addipaddress 1
ok prepare a small paste wondered like you yesterday that the 0 1 2 9 is never shown in the
waigani the magic fixes 1479931 was missing i am adding it and requeing the merge hmm wait 1
addipaddress adds an alive address right you too safe travels 0
does n t the entity watcher only trigger on dead addresses if i ve suggested adding it at debug sorry
http paste ubuntu com 11965055 p i see 0
imho not but would have to look it s only a mapping stringwatcher which maps the received string values to
i wondered because another existing test adding a new ip does n t fail but it uses the existing machine
looking at the code to remind myself what was implemented yeah i can recreate the failure debugging it more now
me too digging deeper and adding more logs have to remove them afterwards phew yep np 0
so the worker starts the watcher on setup as soon as we land it is release time 0
show me your latest branch code please and as i said the ip assigned to the new machine is dropped
the branch is here https github com themue juju tree addresser worker using api this is weird 0
so far looking at state api and apiserver watcher code i ca n t see any obvious flaws that might
now simply created a 0 1 2 10 and added it to the 1st machine initialized in setup it funnily
heya o feeling better today good for work but not for hangout but getting closer with the test problem assigning
i do n t see your worker implementing setup where it should start the watcher does n t solve the
ah i saw it below not yet done but deeper heads down in the lifecycle watcher wondering about its merge
yep i took a deeper look at merge with the individual states of the ips etc 0
hey btw there s a 30m scheduling conflict for os juju call and networking roadmap one that is not a
yeah just started a state browsing of ipaddressesc to look exactly there i guess the os call is more important
it wont be ovious to the user they only get a single resource and thats not a one size fits
the one with jamespage but i do like to know that i m not just talking to myself 0
testing now you are good they are the same 1
ugh nvm i see cheers then 1
if i ve suggested adding it at debug sorry yes all other tests are fine 1
waitforinitialdead should almost immediately see 2 dead ips 0 1 2 4 and 0 1 2 6 right what stuff
the idea is for local file images to load them first fetching the ipaddress from state and then calling ensuredead
it s not what will happen in real life the address being dead is a side effect of the machine
you mean in testworkerremovesdeadaddress that s what i found in the existing tests any luck isolating the issue 0
show me your latest branch code please the failing one is testmachineremovaltriggersworker 1
but machine removal should indeed trigger set all allocated ips to dead for this machine id gave you one last
so the original test already has been wrong can remove it then just asked the bot to land it 0
no let s think first why it s failing 0
so only testmachineremovaltriggersworker fails ok cool 0
armhf images will not run on amd64 for example and vice versa yes and the ip address is dead see
because we now do n t have a direct state watcher anymore but using the api exactly the rest works
okay then there s the problem 1
bug 1479653 opened state depends on system clock tech debt juju core triaged https launchpad net bugs 1479653 already the
see removing a machine should include an op to ensure all alive ips of that machine end up dead without
the one with jamespage so i d dig more into the list of ops machine ensuredead and or remove includes
yeah just started a state browsing of ipaddressesc to look exactly there since that would also work for the location
i do n t know that we want to make that standard practice but some people may certainly ask for
ugh sorry i keep forgetting that as it is alive yes the logs should show it like log 0 00
show me your latest branch code please i seriously hope we dial down this log message to trace level image
hmm that s right the ids are ok at that point so far i have n t touched the log
i think this is a problem with 1 22 6 not 1 24 3 4 the upgrade is failing when
the modification on worker level has been less than thought mostly moving the release stuff to server side and change
testing now state ensureipaddressdeadop looks dangerous on its own without an assert isalivedoc and the corresponding handing of erraborted where
mm strange i think you will have to make some changes by hand i see so the original intention has
unless you re trying to get hyper specific with arch and support multi arch in the charm one usage is
so here the first four addresses are the normal ones yeah that s the one without an assert set the
and one is in ipaddress ensuredead with an assert isalivedoc you mean in testworkerremovesdeadaddress that s what i found in
is n t the api watcher a kind of polling have you tried 1 adding s state startsync just after
i took a deeper look at merge with the individual states of the ips etc looking at the sequence of
o however since opschan is buffered that should n t be the case unless buffer size of 10 is somehow
addipaddress adds an alive address right already tried with a larger buffer and played with the startsync s not sure
need to get in a call let s continue later also i will hit the delay in lp s builders
ok so if the file replaces the image name then it wo n t matter how many images are in
well after that i ca n t run any juju command any luck isolating the issue 1
not yet done but deeper heads down in the lifecycle watcher wondering about its merge if you want to specify
one moment showing you an interesting log fragment need some help upgrading juju 1 23 to 1 24 3 0
ok and calling that earlier in open 0
yep http paste ubuntu com 11966200 1
we could also use the remote api instead of wrapping the cmd so here the first four addresses are the
nothing should just remove ips without releasing them the machine removal just triggers set to dead the 0 1 2
it wont be ovious to the user they only get a single resource and thats not a one size fits
it looks to me the lifecycle watcher is receiving entities with wrongly prefixed ids i do n t even see
so i d dig more into the list of ops machine ensuredead and or remove includes w r t ipaddressesc
so i have to see what merge exactly does regarding schema and default values 0
hmm that s right the ids are ok at that point yes as those belong to machine2 0
merge should combine the updates with the entities with known life and produce ids for the changes yep 0
http paste ubuntu com 11965055 and you can imagine the large number or debug statements lol 1
and here it drops the 0 1 2 9 maybe after its machine has been removed looking looking at the
nothing should just remove ips without releasing them the machine removal just triggers set to dead ok my session is
any part of juju upon detailed inspection looks weird i would be a bit careful about the use of the
rofl thanks for motivational remarks from argentina if you want to specify both then you define two processes 0
yep and i do n t get why 0 1 2 3 is even there 1
it wont be ovious to the user they only get a single resource and thats not a one size fits
hi yeah 0
you mean the received one and you can imagine the large number or debug statements lol 0
yeah that s is nothing to worry about 0
you re right the machine as well as its ips are n t touched during the test have you got
http paste ubuntu com 11966320 to understand where and what i m logging in the lifecycle watcher imho not but
it seems more and more like a sync issue to me but i ve not seen it done personally because
have you tried dropping all startsync calls heya o 0
that s the problem p yes the log is w o sync as well as w sync after the assert
okay does n t change anything 1
and as i said the ip assigned to the new machine is dropped in the notifications while the one for
look how different the 9 and the 10 behave but looking say tomcat loading a warfile has a different process
it is going in to feature proc mgmt branch 0
weird issue indeed ok 0
ok boah no you do n t get it 1
i d prefer to either let the charm do the loading itself during install or add a new field that
and i ve seen that the 9 always is dead looking at the existing things rocket docker runc its all
of the pointed stuff that is and never known as alive 1
i d prefer to either let the charm do the loading itself during install or add a new field that
that sounds like the desired behavior for watchers consolidating multiple changes between two events o 0
ericsnow is n t the api watcher a kind of polling 1
because we now do n t have a direct state watcher anymore but using the api you can not make
ok how about this instead of sleeping for 30s just add a short attempt loop between machine removal and adding
sure the hard coded sleep just has been a test yes all other tests are fine 0
did you guys get my email cheers 1
pong never mind the change breaks the state unit tests 0
good the state persistence story wo n t land bug 1478024 looping config changed hooks in fresh juju core 1
all others will be done by eod friday any part of juju upon detailed inspection looks weird 0
of the pointed stuff that is so only testmachineremovaltriggersworker fails 0
i can live with that yes and the ip address is dead see the adderts following to the machine removal
all others will be done by eod friday we have some low prio overhead that probably wo n t get
understood glad the pointed work is mostly landed not quite sure i follow you please describe the steps when the
ericsnow ty just wanted to check in i would be a bit careful about the use of the word resource
i do n t know that we want to make that standard practice but some people may certainly ask for
dibs on the python library lol the failing one is testmachineremovaltriggersworker 0
dang it wwitzel3 lazypower what do you guys think about adding a resource key to the process info that gets
weird issue indeed we should pair up 1
the available api requests are quite limited though you too safe travels 1
looking at the sequence of ops it looks like waitforreleaseop is timing out because the apiserver has no chance of
the change comes later but it is related to an already existing machine 1
okay then carry on streaking mhhh look at this 0
as soon as we land it is release time once you export its a single package per container i can
what stuff addipaddress adds an alive address right 0
alexisb mgz robie had a brilliant idea to solve the deoloyer quicikstart pyjujuclient problem maybe we can include those plugins

tych0 is adding lxd support to juju core i m glad you re feeling better 0
the 0 1 2 10 is instead created for the existing machine thumper and mramm have been pondering that 1

hi half day for me heading to airport in 30min 0
ug these juju status tests are horrible i was trying to upgrade juju in maas environment 1
after running juju upgrade juju testing now 0
machine0 log says http paste ubuntu com 11967995 waitforinitialdead should almost immediately see 2 dead ips 0 1 2 4
all machines are online machine0 log http paste ubuntu com 11967995 the updates map contains all known ips so far
yes and nothing happend bug 1478156 summary format does not give enough details about machine provisioning errors charmers juju core
show me your latest branch code please same log 1
ls var lib juju tools http paste ubuntu com 11968047 i do n t think that s a good idea
agents tools are there but not linked the updates map contains all known ips so far all with the env
also i will hit the delay in lp s builders if i see a fix in ci i can just
wwitzel3 k got ta run to another meeting ty again and if i do n t talk to you before
mhhh look at this 1
http paste ubuntu com 11968067 so i d dig more into the list of ops machine ensuredead and or remove
the rest are links heya o 0
p i see ok fixed by hand 0
lol could n t read wrench directory stat var lib juju wrench no such file or directory 1
that s is nothing to worry about wwitzel3 lazypower what do you guys think about adding a resource key to
i suppose that rsyslogd 2039 could no open output pipe dev xconsole no such file or directory try http www
so only testmachineremovaltriggersworker fails is not a problem too 1
ok fixed by hand will do 1
the idea is for local file images to load them first you mean the received one 0
and i ve seen that the 9 always is dead sort of a problem the name of the tar file
so if we re given foo tar as something to load and run we can load it but we wo
wwitzel3 will have to take it from here i do n t know enough about that well i suppose that
well you wouldnt hve 2 images in a single tar ok actually looks like a tar can have multiple images
yeah looking at some of the other tools out there that wrap docker they take an inventory first using docker
then they load it and parse the diff however since opschan is buffered that should n t be the case
does n t solve the problem if more than one image is loaded from the tar file agents tools are
it does since we would parse out both of them and they can only specify a single image name in
but i thought the feature was that the image name is the tar file i knew that but did n
gave you one last review lgtm with some minor caveats then they load it and parse the diff 0
thanks did you guys get my email 0
np i would be a bit careful about the use of the word resource 0
well in that case we could launch and register both sorry iu have two email with your name first i
ls var lib juju tools http paste ubuntu com 11968047 or we could leave image as is and make the
so does this seem like a useful feature is the idea that someone will package a tar file in their
i ca n t remember the reason for it it was based on some feedback we got iirc sorry 0
i really dont feel like having state all over again seems like it needs to be better defined before we
i do n t even see a card for it and i do n t get why 0 1 2
joyent and gce are the fastest clouds i tend to use joyent oh there it is overhead 1
yeah who knows yep 1
so if the file replaces the image name then it wo n t matter how many images are in the
afaik it s not in the spec so maybe that answers the question i do n t think that s
been working with fwereade on this blocker issue maybe if we added a loadfrom field in the process info that
hey btw there s a 30m scheduling conflict for os juju call and networking roadmap one i do n t
awesome ack 0
o i love a man that knows what he wants 1
the change comes later but it is related to an already existing machine ok my session is over whaaatt would
are there some shared creds for the core team or do i need to create my own account well so
afaik it s not in the spec so maybe that answers the question anyone more or less familiar with environ
sounds good this is something we added to the spec late last week in response to feedback katco got prepping
hey it was n t my idea should be fine 0
well i think having another field for the uri seperate from the image is fine 1
np since that would also work for the location of a private docker registry 1
that seems fine unless you wanted to specify both awesome 0
load the images from this tar into this registry or is that not a thing the state server will refuse
if you want to specify both then you define two processes but i would n t cut a release until
packing two images in to a single tar is n t that common from what i know lazypower might have
okay i will watch the merge and retry as needed but i ve not seen it done personally because the
well you wouldnt hve 2 images in a single tar we re looking at that one now 0
sorry but i would n t cut a release until they say it s done 0
i ve given up and just assume i m always talking to myself as well you should be 1
the one with jamespage wwitzel3 lazypower what do you guys think about adding a resource key to the process info
i would be a bit careful about the use of the word resource already tried with a larger buffer and
at long as it makes sense as a general feature and not just mostly docker specific 1
i presume other container technologies might need a separate step for install the image before running it but i do
ping when you want to merge because i might just as well release your fix yeah who knows 1
all others will be done by eod friday looking at the existing things rocket docker runc its all basically the
ditto for now we could just support it with a type option 1
forgot about that escape hatch ahh yeah type options that makes sense 1
that seems fine unless you wanted to specify both forgot about that escape hatch 1
yep that s why we added them does n t solve the problem if more than one image is loaded
sounds good it wont be ovious to the user they only get a single resource and thats not a one
ericsnow is this going into a different branch than what landed for the concept wwitzel3 did i love a man
just keeps going up nope it ll go into feature proc mgmt 1
first time too it is going in to feature proc mgmt branch 1
i ll ping when i m working on it tomorrow hmm this feels like the entitywatcher is forwarding the initial
awesome ty and as i said the ip assigned to the new machine is dropped in the notifications while the
once you export its a single package per container i can see someone trying to work around an artificial limitation
from the same report we can see http reports vapour ws releases 2934 that the 22 jobs failed let s
did you guys get my email yeah i can recreate the failure debugging it more now 1
we still have bug 1479931 sorry iu have two email with your name first i had to make them non
i think this is a problem with 1 22 6 not 1 24 3 4 the upgrade is failing when
maybe we should try 1 22 7 1 22 tip if it works it is an incentive to relesse as
i can give that a try after this debug run i m doing now yeah who knows 0
so yes it is a syncing problem but different from state startsync indeed it is installing packafes seems to be
heya themue joyent and gce are the fastest clouds i tend to use joyent 1
need to get in a call let s continue later are there some shared creds for the core team or
in cloud city yes you can use default joyent and you can try different regions thank you i may need
no the state server still accepts connections during an upgrade anyone alive in here 0
sort of a problem the name of the tar file bears no relation to the name of the image the
status should still work awesome 0
the not authorized for status error is worrying ok 0
also the very high connection count it appears that the state server is hung trying to unpack the tools and
something in juju is n t releasing the connections understood glad the pointed work is mostly landed 0
that s probably not the root cause but related to it you around 0
t is used to introduce failures into juju the authorization errors sounds closer the root cause 1
nothing should just remove ips without releasing them the machine removal just triggers set to dead menn0 help i do
looking i think it s a bad idea to munge the idea of images with the tar files that docker
i m going to setup a build and get a container running for this while its under active dev if
that s is nothing to worry about this will fix bug 1478024 1
but i would n t cut a release until they say it s done hey btw there s a 30m
based on the commit messages it looks like they re close though the branch is here https github com themue
what stuff i see this in the context od thumper mgz and alexis a few hours ago 1
we had to make the two jobs that show the regression non voting which conviced ci that ere was a
i see this in the context od thumper mgz and alexis a few hours ago never mind i just saw
hey i was afk how did you cool makes sense 1
we are jugglin a nasty case of a regression in the wild 1 24 4 is better than 1 24
i think so i really do n t like releasing in this rush i officially eoded lat hour i do
i think so i really do n t like releasing in this rush i officially eoded lat hour understood glad
i do n t think we should release another 1 24 until this one is figured out we can replace
ok ok fixed by hand 0
this one should be fixed soon i think i m getting a sense of the problem from the logs o
also i will hit the delay in lp s builders if i see a fix in ci i can just
sounds good hey btw there s a 30m scheduling conflict for os juju call and networking roadmap one 0
okay i m just finishing some stuff for will probably get to it around 11am just asked the bot to
half day for me heading to airport in 30min np i m looking at this upgrade issue anyway 1
testing now dang it 0
and calling that earlier in open thank you i may need to wait though hp cloud got relested and a

you rock as does cherylj i will let ci accept the current failure and wait for the fix already tried
http paste ubuntu com 11965055 looking 1
never mind the change breaks the state unit tests at long as it makes sense as a general feature and
this is going to take longer i see so the original intention has been to set the address to dead
but i do like to know that i m not just talking to myself yes d brilliant m going to
from the same report we can see http reports vapour ws releases 2934 that the 22 jobs failed ok i
just keeps going up should be fine 1

hello i have a problem eh 1
a feature d it s be a performance hit 1
thanks what s the argument for 1
ok understood that means i ll have to roll my own i need precise timestamps in order to measure latency
thanks thanks i will test it but my guess is that this really needs a fix commit by ms 0
oh ok so it s simply a bug in the code then oh right 0
i d not call that a bug i can look at it 0
i d call that sensible behaviour selecting the same abilities in as many arches as possible i ve just filed
no i mean the kernel panic there are no new commits that were specifically targeted this bug this new test
shall i use ubuntu bug after the panic or would a simple bug report be enough i guess do you
as its not an official version it wo n t let you a simple report with the panic stack will

we think we are i think you should shut the old one down so we know for sure nonetheless i
as far as i know everything has been updated and i have just re re started the only persistent bit
let us know when it s down gone heh no not by accident the option was expanded to new architectures

that was discuessed on the kernel team mailing list iirc the wily archive raspi2 kernel should work i m busily

i did switch to 3 2 0 90 before but the driver seems not working at all oh and i
ok and its been in wily for a bit which i have been testing with i ll look closer at

if you wanted to be pro level it is possible to have one flash drive in the usb2 slot that
it works here i do n t think i would work because grub wo n t recognize pcie usb in

not necessarily true just because the bios wo n t allow booting device xyz that does n t mean that
the recognition of usb3 will be done using usb3 driver in linux kernel i do n t think grub will

msg alis list kodi yes if you willing to answer 1
how many ghz i m not sure what exactly you mean by mediaplayer but perhaps plex 0
should be at least 2ghz if you want decent power perhaps so 0
we have no idea what that means this is the ubuntu support irc channel do other stuff work 1

after standby hibernation could mean that not all needed modules get activated after resume yes 0
thunar is quite nice and very fast never seen as limited options inside the router config 0
thank you the result is error unknown filesystem because hd1 msdos1 is ntgs 0
thanks for the help the standard on ubuntu is nautilus 1
try them both and find out thunar is my favourite pcmnfm is another choice i see something a littttle bit
who knows this is a script for uploading file using ftp 0

grub install actually compiles links the modules into the single executable we call core img done 1
i would like to set umask giving rwx for owner and x for others and group i think you ran
the reason the intel driver is n t loading is the kernel command line is disabling dri with nomodeset that
it has nothing to do with the kernel version but the parameter nomodeset prevents the driver controlling the gpu modes
just click on the nm icon on your top panel unity nope but i removed ecryptfs 1
grep nomodeset etc default grub when i clicked manage printers 0
hello this returns nothing 1
werkt ok you did n t edit boot grub grub cfg directly did you 1
nop anyway i ve reinstalled unity ok when you booted the system did you manually add nomodeset to the kernel
i take it you ve disabled the nvidia from the bios or something yeah 0
why s that data stored in gdm s user session the xorg 0 log file you provided has on its
identify the most recent log file most recent last with ls latr var log xorg log and pastebin the most
it s saved in your session there is an existing file 1
http paste ubuntu com 12717976 no it s xorg 0 log and we probably want another 1

what is the local time on the problem pc right now date put bye at the end 0
run top or htop to see what s eating your resoruces ok so the xorg 0 log was the most
mh maybe or remove the problem kernel 0
the recognition of usb3 will be done using usb3 driver in linux kernel i do n t think grub will
reboot hold down shift key immediately the screen displays anything and keep it held down until the grub boot menu
doing that will not load the gui it will start in text console mode the kernel team supply continuous mainline
then log in on the text console and try starting the gui with sudo systemctl start graphical target fuckin game
filezilla has a server setup as well which ubuntu release is it 1
once you d attempted to start the gui you may need to switch back to the text console using ctrl
if the same goes on the same what goes on i m not sure i understand ok i have no
i dont want to use macchanger what ubuntu release is it 1
ok so sudo service lightdm start the exact line 0
is there a way for youtube dl to auto save things title and artist etc to the audio properties but

well i m not a grub pro so i ca n t advise further but if it were my system
sunrise in uk suggests the pc has locked up try alt sysrq s 1
there is n t any hd1 msdos2 yup not working 1
sysreq is a magic kernel key usually as an option on the print scrn key if it failed i will
with ssh you can run a tail on the kernel log and capture the last messages when it locks up
hard reboot if the keyboard is not getting a response edit the boot menu again to use text and then
ok yup ill test that but i cant do it here got to go 1
tj how s it going no it is enabled but some functions are disabled sync boot are enabled 1
anybody else other than the people currently discussing other topics ok well good luck the more decent data you can
oh good to know why do you guess that 0
yeah its kinda ironic in that way a security oriented distro that breaks the most basical security principle ever dont
so we need to try modifying the printer again and change the uri once more for avprobe libav tools source
is the root file system on dev sda1 is the only difference between apt file and apt cache the debian
no apt cache searches actual package info apt file searches the files in those packages afaik does echo user show

i had some problems i was doing well on ubuntu i had several tabs at least 10 15 p but
ok so you installed ubuntu to the seagate hdd no separate boot i deleted them using gparted in live usb

thanks i am still installing those packages my internet is still a little slow il pastebin the last part of

being able to avoid a gui and get to the text of logs and config files makes solving these issues

administration printers manage printers thanks k1l bud 0
i ll check again but i try to do this many times ahhh so it went missing 1
is the printer a network printer do other stuff work 0
connected over the network and via usb i tested it doesn 0
you said the printer was also connected to the pc so i assumed you meant using usb yeah it was
the result is error unknown filesystem because hd1 msdos1 is ntgs if you wanted to be pro level it is
so assuming the pc has all the hplip packages installed then in cups administration add printer is it enabling starting

yeah i did that before so we can look at the log files 1
ubuntu 15 04 64 bit brother mfc6490cw all in one printer and scanner they do n t communicate but i
hm it is very weird because when i mount that partition it contains boot but in grub rescue it sees

i suggest you sudo apt get install pastebinit if you have n t already aha if you delete etc init
a command line pasting tool does all the hard work for you could 0
and has a button that you press and it ejects the drive from the top like toast out of a

pick lxc or openvz and then ask the channel on that containment system about it any other partitions 1
i have many partitions on my enternal hdd but only msdos1 is ext4 others are either ntfs or swap pci
looking back the only other option is hd1 msdos2 i think ok on manual 0
ubuntu uses strictly sudo just forget about the hey i am cool and a linux guru i run root all
earlier you showed hd0 hd0 msdos3 hd0 msdos1 hd1 hd1 msdos2 hd1 msdos1 fd0 as devices grub found is there
i deleted them using gparted in live usb hp net ip 10 0 0 10 0
then install on legacy show me pastebinit tail n 500 var log syslog 1
ok and one of the was a separate file system for boot so you ve done some invasive manual changes
yeah one of them was boot but i deleted them both made a new ext4 partition instead of them and
there s a lot of unexpected crud there related to org gtk vfs daemon does the hp printer have memory
but i can see files inside boot when i mount that partition in live usb but i do n t

try them both and find out thunar is my favourite pcmnfm is another choice that suggests to me the install

why do you guess that i disconnect sata cable of the internal hdd and still going to grub rescue 1
it s an hp compaq 6910p so core img is in ext hdd 1

for the package see http debian hypra fr debian no really it just creats the initial web site 1

morning btw the issue with the end of file was the unity server which served invalid files for a couple
iirc it s using config user dir i thought so maybe not 0
and then pitti thinks again all those french guys know each other you probably need to kill nautilus as well
those are fine they got created after logging back in there are no more upstream real upstream per say but
so iirc the old issue was that the version of usb modeswitch died and left you in the usb data
do you have modem manager installed or have you removed it to flash the phone at any point we have

a usb modeswitch from the cli makes it appear and work so to build the gsettings profiles you need to

right so sound like possibly one for cyphermox who fixed it last time and needed ejecting 0
it might be that the fix got dropped by the new imports hey larsu 0

you mean on package installation or does n t it start the localized versions that is left side pane links
for starting and 3d we might need some extra measures such as configuring the dummy driver bonjour didrocks et pitti

it depends a lot on the types of testing you want to do number of channels you want to test
http notyetthere org data2 level25 m4v it sounds like nice 0
silo reconfigured at blazing speed d it seems ubuntuone credentials has always used native no 0ubuntun it does n t
hey are you looking at landing 033 error by any chance can i retry it s easy enough to do
is the usage of native version numbers intentional if so you should continue doing that by dropping the 0ubuntu1 from
ok the ubuntuone credentials branch is simply broken it adds its own changelog entry that would n t be a
right timing related there s an issue with the 2x button 1
thanks indeed probably none of them are needed as rtm is now done in click scope we have 15 04
i would say it s up to the project maintainers to decide this all depends if you forsee doing any
lol in light of yesterday s discussions the default would be that you target only 15 04 do n t
man you spend one week with qa and you think it s your job to break things i think you
it depends a lot on the types of testing you want to do number of channels you want to test
i d guess since the target changed it might be best i reconfigure it for you but i wanted to
hey yes since we wanted to continue having vivid overlay based images in devel after the cdimage server switched focus

btw ubuntu app usage grep machines please d no worries 0
to make sure both branches are in sync nooooo 1
it seems nearly exactly 24h i did try without the laserhouse you know when i say loading components that means
oi play fair p otto builds are known to be broken right now 0
if you are going to pick on at least get his nick right so he can join in the complaining
which flaw it was that you ran into i remember you mentioned it 0
no you have to discover it for yourself p one second 0
darn mps in silo 33 updated let me know if i can reconfigure 0
i love it i would use the editor thingy to add some more levels but it looks like hard work
thanks but the root cause of the issue is still unknown 0
do n t fork i meant you do n t want me touching code if you want it to work
which flaw it was that you ran into i remember you mentioned it no code involved it s just json
json is close enough to code for me to break ubuntu bug 1454198 in ubuntu reminders app it s not
ohh i was looking at https code launchpad net appmenu gtk and turned my brain off ah sorry updated the

done rvr trying doing a search for it 0
there is click on the star count in the lower right corner in the level selector hey no not really
approved thanks ok i did n t know of these subtleties trying to fix the changelog entry 1
hi per the point raised above has a full sync of the ppa to wily been discussed or planned 0
or plars might be a good idea 0
we could test that by rekicking this job a few times without the hook right i wanted a round number
regarding silo 24 jenkins has been flaky for telephony service it runs the unit tests twice for each job once
ah sorry updated the mp itself it was targeting trunk should be touch 15 04 could you please reconfigure again
thanks if you can help me understand exactly what information you re looking for i may be able to email
i would n t know how that affects it it used to work and suddenly all branches fail in this
not also that is the problem d 0
in this case copy package is still a valid solution i guess ah that s something new 0
ok i can do that so it all started with this https trello com c tbw1ocqb 1665 ubuntu landing 024
the only think nice about otto tests is that they produce videos of the failures but i agree most of
done btw ubuntu app usage grep machines please d 0
just quickly tried that no i do n t seem to get the 12 17 in order to buy the
but the root cause of the issue is still unknown where do we go from here 1
a spreadsheet is never the path of least resistance the benchmark test is just loading tons of compoennts nothing more
not also that is the problem cool thx 1
details what external servers does it want to connect to are the connections inbound or outbound how is it communicating
is there an equivalent of a changes ml for the overlay ppa huh there s no servers involved it s
boiko is the owner he will have more details when i say loading components that means grabbing qml files from
and that test has n t changed in eons really trainguards hey can i have a silo for line 62
it could only legitimately fail that i can see if somehow the build folder was removed during the build that
it looks like a great number of tests in there pass too though do those not depend on loading things
the basic symptom of this problem is that the package s tests are executed twice that s not something that
https code launchpad net tpeeters ubuntu ui toolkit trunksync merge 258777 failed on autolanding actually it may have failed even
still i did that try at 1x but i ve noticed 2x breaks things ah it failed as far back
hmmmm the tools are not ready yet to make things easier for people 0
actually that could make a lot of since given that branch did change the directory structure even though i do
ack ack so i know why it did n t appear in the ppa 1
but the root cause of the issue is still unknown i wanted a round number to get an idea how
hi did that patch land can i retry my build i hope it s soemthing i broke i like breaking
well has a new rtm silo from yesterday so i guess it s not all done necessarily in your mp
yeah i got to give it some more time with 1x only at some point so the builder went like
man you spend one week with qa and you think it s your job to break things not also that
plars now that you are at it we have been having failures on dialer app jenkins jobs too for instance
ack dropped the concierce mode branch again no idea why it was still showing up in my queue yesterday it
i actually originally had that then did a test build in my ppa and forgot to undo that change hey

o so it seems jenkins run and then later it calls make test is that correct 1
i replied to that one i run them multiple times on desktop chromebook and on the device and they always
we could test that by rekicking this job a few times without the hook right complex naming i realize but
plars boiko it s also possible that without this project will stop producing code coverage results it all depends on
do n t fork i meant so as long as coverage telephony service will generate those 1
sounds like 10 just the others are needed to other gcover dependencies 1
plars now that you are at it we have been having failures on dialer app jenkins jobs too for instance
i included those already otto builds are known to be broken right now 1
ah ok so just the dialer one remains i can reconfigure your silo if you tell me how i can
it sounds like nice should we add that disclaimer to the channel topic 1
hey ah it landed but i need to ask is to redeploy the train is there a global switch that
should be easy to make your script spit out the values you need to append to the ss no the
i think they run gtests which was a google project o 0
plars telephony service uses qtest not gtests weird failure in my silo 33 0
boiko that one seems to have passed and produced coverage results no code involved it s just json files describing
that looks better i d give boiko a chance to comment but i think that s probably the best fix
yes that s only a one time sync of the stuff currently in the overlay however so iiuc i ll

in an alternate universe where we can coordinate that number of projects yes d perfect thank you 0
start now or it ll never happen when i say loading components that means grabbing qml files from the build

it sounds like nice fyi i know how to deal with the benchmark test now a fix is in progress
that looks like it should work is it safe to assume that the 13 10 branches all alias the trunk
there is for a video that you record more importantly for you guys i think if they do n t

yes on android well but i ddoubt you want any autopilot testing you want real world testing 0
because we need to implement the functions to interface with the pebble fw and then implement the functions in ubuntu

nope but you cant just re flash the android device with ubuntu partition schemes are different 0

fix is landing now ubuntu system settings autopilot depends on python3 dbusmock 0 14 however 0
ah i did n t see any critical bug thanks 0

hello all would anyone be up for answering a question regarding ota upgrades i m not sure if this is
probably twitter or g token i do n t think polld cares about u1 token would be good if you
i do n t really know but when the discussion ends and a solution is chosen we can fast track
they re all pretty happy with it so far so now i count on them to bug their friends too
probably twitter or g token i do n t think polld cares about u1 token there yu got an expert
sorry i m beginning messages does n t go away when i removed account adding u1 account again hangs at
did you delete your twitter and or google account or just u1 i just flashed ubuntu from bootloader this time
just u1 i ll try to remove others ah hm i do n t know if the notification subsystem has
yes you can copy paste the parts you think are important into the bug description of the older bug ok
but should n t it do something automatically i m not sure if i ll be able to go to
you need the right recovery that is promoted in the documentation for flashing feel free to file a bug against
it is th same as on every mx4 international edition thanks 0
ok i see so i will have to design into it to monitor both those notification sources https bugs launchpad
is kaleo the current camera app maintainer the mtk tool is public it also runs on linux but are all
ok oh well so it just needs to monitor push ubuntu com and account polld then seperatly for both for
yes elaborate if you can please 1
we discussed this yesterday as far as i understood there will be a generic framework on the device you can
how are you going to monitor the services do they have an api for that the process that asks for
all the pebble is designed for is to show notifications form your phone so ie something needs to be designed
hi what i was thinking of was some sort of background deamon to do the job 1
yes there is a similar one already is kaleo the current camera app maintainer 0
right testing on my private sim which has a voice mail service enabled so there s the answer yes you
just check in system settings yu should set all the version info etc there and then mark the one you
or you add a comment with your additions ok 0
so what is html5 app if you update the bug description it would be great if you could mark it
hope it helps try to remove your u1 account and re add it 0
also if you file bugs against ubuntu ux could you be so kind to find the corresponding package and file
ah hm i do n t know if the notification subsystem has an api for that here is a list
even if design is aware of the bug developers need to be too so they can plan ahead so i
just do n t install the ubuntu system settings autopilot package it s pretty likely that the following will work
hwclock ioctl to dev rtc to set the time failed invalid argument if it is in the android hal it
melon was asking about wifi ap what does their functionality does their time daemon provide we have ntp support 1
reboot into recovery full wipe back 0
i think it allows me to set hardware clock normal hwclock w does n t work on my phone i
it keeps time reasonably correct across reboots on nexus5 and similar devices iirc we discussed this yesterday as far as
qml and javascript if you want to go deeper you can use c qt just guessing though 0
i suppose you could put into fastboot mode wipe all the partitions and rebuild everything from scratch pushed fix for
sorry you have to only install the debs i mentioned yeah that sounds all fine then 0
any suggestions for a phone to buy with ubuntu touch compatibility in the states my bad d 1
but clearly it is you do n t have to wipe though only flash 1
i can not enable developer mode on wily help sounds like you need a custom recovery 1
no the qml apps are qml apps ogra rocks my socks 0
either of the latter two not sure which one i dont know if everything landed yet oh ok but there
for prototyping that is the easiest the best is the qmake project with simple qml ui 0
you might want to join ubuntu app devel is there a way to reset the phone entirely not just the
s with why can i just bug you to bug them for me 1
sure that ll be 50 000 i am pertty sure that polld does n t care about u1 tokens 0
i ll take two and you need a recovery with adb enabled for this 0
aha then i ll toy until it breaks it s very difficult to do that 1
souffle un bon coup if we keep this much longer i should probably add it to git and do some
i hear that and i m like oh shit got to get to seb128 non non ils cassent tous le
pourtant c est la bonne saison pour les nuages thanks can you add it to the bug i m going
en effet just the title 0
oui oui je dirais juste je veux qu ils marchent try with sudo just in case 0
ah merci is there some difference in the ordering of the way maintscripts configs run 0
guten morgen gut danke und dir you might want to open a bug report as well 0

sorry i tought it was one hour later o you can turn in your british citizenship at the door 1
forget about some api changes and yeah it was likely leaking before not yet but i suspect the last cloud
it s on my list i think it s a combinaison of the window being small by default the ui
not that much just that it now does n t forget about some architectures some times i e bug fixes
are you and the results cache data format changed 1
the weird part is that it s the registering we now have the run ids of the individual tests there
and for the running ones i plan to point to running shtml instead no need to use evolution for this

are you it s not i keep the master copy on my laptop and just parallel scp it 1
if we keep this much longer i should probably add it to git and do some credentials templating like on
and it does not have config but still getting the question on release upgrades btw it s on my list
ah so gdm s postrm calls debconf again so it s 30ms 0
well not explicitly so far as i can see but something fishy like that is going on here i think

but i m currently wrestling with lxd and firewall proxy again so that at some point we can cloudify this

was the previous code leaking i see you added unref calls in that one i did it as a transitional
you can disable it it will just mask them but you can still get the other tasks 0
indeed logs uses the standard text size and log viewer a smaller one but i m currently wrestling with lxd
i think it s broken with 2fa accounts maybe i do n t know i ve the feeling i ve
yeah looking at it and trying to find the differences easy to fix though 0
it s not hidden from the api side fyi the lag on dab is very annoying 0
is it no i probably did n t directly ping you i raised as a topic on the channel and
a bit smaller text or bigger window would n t hurt probably account console list 0

already tried nothing hikiko andyrock https plus google com hangouts canonical com place holder authuser 0 0

what s the impact of targeting the bugs the triaging we did was done on the ubuntu packages right so

my point is it is n t replacing bin sh so not the explanation you mean since the stick is
just show me the current complete update initramfs log so i should run ubuntu bug from the livesystem rather than
10 out of 10 for helpful error messages no i do n t mind that i just want to check
but if they re all hardlinked at that point what happens when the cp copies over cat gee what do
not hardlinked literally duplicates they all get overwritten 0

here is a screenshot http s24 postimg org bv8fodwvp 1444605589763 jpg you were right it works with dd out of
very instructive journey yeah i would not suggest dd to many endusers because of the risk to destroy everything if

one thing that worries me there is that those fixes are in stable so that effectively broke or will break
besides that s the kernel s job in my opinion did you configure the system to suspend on overheat 1
i ca n t actually think of a situation where any of my machines have overheated well let s instrument
only reason i can think of where a laptop would overheat is a blocked fan didnt the thermal handling switch
i ca n t actually think of a situation where any of my machines have overheated the temperature limits come
have you tried installing cpufrequtils and changing the governor of the cpus so like install linux generic lts vivid and
really it should not sit at that temp for a long time ugg those bios are broke only reason i
which would take it out of auto switching from bios to userspace control of the fans it does n t
the problem is the bios says to the kernel do not do this i have it in hand so the
series is it not in the bug report not necessarily that just means it got told it had to shutdown
so i see in the bug you mentioned there is a suggestion to run thinkfan with a specific config have
what series are you running a point indeed 1
it might be in the bug report but it would have been easier to tell me than tell me its
ok thats good so it is the new version so like install linux generic lts vivid and and then reboot

what series are you running ok record all that in the bug and i ll ask someone to have a

pitti do you know why the apport autopkgtest has been failing for ages mousepad merge should be fixed 1
no but we can suggest a name change and then execute on it if they agree you just edit debdiff
i edited it manually i think the malformed line is from a missing whitespace line i do n t think
it s a question of quality work you could just use dch script and rebuild a source then you can
you take it as easy stuff and your reason is a fact you still do n t have upload access

my main reason for using the gui was its help in finding the right packages alternatives and supplementary packages you
can you try hexchat 2 10 0 os linux 3 17 6 031706 generic distro ubuntu utopic 14 10 cpu
apt get s job is to find the right packages and dependencies as for supplements that s a little tougher
paste keithclark maybe i should be using apt get directly most of the time 1
what you call supplementary are known as dependencies it had 2 code like boot options neither of which had ubuntu
the reason i am asking is because i have a lubuntu option there which when you select it and login
well i see another reason for using apt get directly the gui is still running and does n t show
you can also use synaptic package manager it can show you the terminal output ok 0
tell everyone what operating system you have so have you not even tried running boot repair yet 0
i notice that i do n t have synaptic package manager installed i can use the gui or apt get
both will do just a little 0
in terminal type sudo apt get install synaptic this was supposed to be a simple install for a friend 0
i guess i can do apt get even while the gui is still downloading libreoffice how do we make it
yeah i was actually gon na try some games as im new to linux and wanted to see how it
mine is n t i got s u k p t v type it in a terminal and see 1

thank you there were so many automatization recently that i almost thought that i can trigger a publishing process and
with no replaces conflicts for libunity scopes1 0 that may happen one day soon it s all coming together 1

likely today i posted a question about unity8 to saviq and anpok earlier tested by itself the ui does not
i guess he means unity8 qtmir boottest failures thanks i ll get them unblocked then 1
sure i ll look thank you 1
it may be possible with manual futzing but i d have to check into that why are n t the
but that s the only relationship they have they definitely belong in separate landings and hmm the previous landing is
well they only depend on each other because the version number got bumped because of an interface change what makes
is someone grabbing silo 55 very anxious for that one because one silo has a scope of fixing mpris only
so the thing is i can add ppa dependencies the way you describe but it s quite a manual thing
and then it becomes super important for me to remember to undo that change when you re done he needs
so the libunity scopes1 0 binary is in the overlay ppa yeah not a huge deal and i know it
1am here i ll get to it tomorrow so generally it s gon na be a lot easier for me
qa will also want to verify it normally i blame davmor2 p 1

plasma 5 simply is n t ready for production use right now plasma 5 3 1 crashes all the time
it may be mostly due to driver issues or corrupted config files you could open plasmashell in terminal and check

ahh that was indeed enabled what is that option about also it is not drivers issues cuz plasma did work

i thank yourselves for your time it puts me to ease i dont think anything promises that but if you
yes sir maam there is as well gnome video arcade 1
cool try it if things look normal in lxde and you are in a lubuntu session i would say all
from 14 10 to 15 04 or maybe nothing is missing at all but the software doesnt promise a screenshot
maybe not a full second but i dont think you can assume the issue yet could be networking related etc
yes but it is not in lubuntu yes its not there its not in the stock ubuntu repos 1
i did but it does not have screen shot of the games maybe i need to research what content is
all installed from the meta package lubuntu base sure 1
one other issue i have i would greatly appreciate opinions on the matter many of the applications i have come
i ve been using teamspeak3 since it was released and latency is not a feature of the app let alone
as for pidgin again prior to upgrading it had no latency whereas now it has latency and it cuts off

hey i ran all ap s once again during weekend against silo 018 no regressions and i rebuilt it to

thanks i ll take a look soon both the fix for https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source unity8 bug 1430828
i found a way to reproduce https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source unity8 bug 1430828 going to try to get
is n t preview the dash as well well i ll start with 1441822 and if you find a fix
let me know what testing you need let s let tsdgeos focus on the image bit o d 0
fwiw we did not backport your let other requests go while http stuck change to the image loading code did
right it probably does n t do the right thing when you have a temp scope and you want to
it s the only way that warning is triggered right in theory that s the case there are currently just
oh right so we rather want the full monty but we can also switch the dependencies on request 1
right i just wanted to raise awareness same as when i wrote to steve that we need those ppas enabled
yeah reproduced well i need to play with network dhcp to make the thing fail work fail work 1
subpageloader closesubpage not afaik 1
or actually right that my other suspicion 1
i was asking not telling adding that ppa overylay dep to all ppa s silos that is 1
meanwhile unping related to the account adding problems being 018 specific since i seem to have the same spinning animation
so there s two commits one with tha async provider bits 0
ok so 018 krillin or arale generic smoke test with special emphasis on installing apps adding ubuntu account start with
the other one is https codereview qt project org c 108540 hey i m looking at solving https bugs launchpad
looks like it could work but shell is complaining and that will hide the preview 0
i ll do what i can wrt to the mp comments requests so i m in my videos which is
are you sending a gotoscope btw re new landing process so now even if we wanted we ca n t
well in my modified branch only actaully if you emit that one it would work already i think 0
yes it s not going to work with temp scopes so what s next for shellrotation 0
we need a new signal then ubuntu bug 1430828 in canonical system image scopes dont load pictures critical confirmed 0
e g showresults oh right so we rather want the full monty 0
yup i really feel it all came down to network going awry give me a sec 1
i do n t like abusing any other signal for that right that my other suspicion 0
it s the only way that warning is triggered so what we are doing here is close previews 1
yes or actually 0
same question i made the other day ca n t we just hide previews if the scope search string changes
but this is a common piece of code inside the plugin where i do n t know if i m
no the query may be the same unrelated to the crashing 0
the scope may want to just refresh the results sounds like it s all effectively blocked 0
there is yes would it work ah this could be the case 0
food actaully if you emit that one it would work already i think 1
while we re at it can you review this today if you have time https code launchpad net josharenson unity8
k it is but we do 1
no the test is fine from all the mp comments i see they are all this would be nicer to
question is should i try to spend some time in rtm trying to fix it or just wait for something
yeah showdash should work for that if it does n t our bug showdash was always meant as go to
yeah there s a few levels of what we were able to do yes and no i found a case
right it probably does n t do the right thing when you have a temp scope and you want to
qml no match for scope with id mediascanner video we re likely closing the temp scope on showdash actually 1
sorry do n t remember the answer d ah this could be the case 1
right that my other suspicion hmm no it actually breaks if both videos and myvideos are favorited investigating the plugin
so i ll mark the loading images bug as fixed for vivid as pat suggests and hope that the one
bug 1446150 feel free to mark as duplicate so no change needed on our side 0
yup thanks the other one is https codereview qt project org c 108540 0
regarding the unity8 launcher feature parity card splitting up the card into the six remaining checklist points i leave to
question is should i try to spend some time in rtm trying to fix it or just wait for something

s symbols extra output so what s next for shellrotation 1
reviews is it a known bug that when one clicks install and it gives you ubuntu one dialog unity8 dash
is the silo up to date sorry do n t remember the answer d 0
i was asking not telling 0
well i ve not mcuh i can do on the unity8 launcher feature parity front atm no feedback from design
we ve you kgunn to split the card still or 0
right but we ve a stable set of tests atm it s just that review process need to continue right
i ll do what i can wrt to the mp comments requests right it probably does n t do the
but the question is is there a known aspect of the test that fails intermittently the new https code launchpad
so https codereview qt project org c 109756 3 all unified is just the fix for images not stalled by
yup not afaik 0
fwiw we did not backport your let other requests go while http stuck change to the image loading code did
looks like it could work but shell is complaining sure 1
food yup i really feel it all came down to network going awry 1
but this is a common piece of code inside the plugin where i do n t know if i m
i guess i should try to make it happen in vivid now that i made it happen on rtm thanks
there is yes would it work usc handles it 1

i can do that if that s what you want expensive but nice 0
good as well thanks please do 1
there wakka wakka wakka i m here all week 0
a snapshot from autumn could be nice for rtm though specifically a new high contrast option 0
specifically a new high contrast option expensive was around 70 gbp 1
seems the proper branded ones are expensive no name imports are a bit more realistic cheap on ebay 10 1
k the wedge mobile keyboard from microsoft can be found for around 60eur not as expensive as 70gbp but still
kenvandine built in ppa mitya57 test2 it just sits there doing nothing 0
thanks what s that coffee and a cigarette 0
thanks in theory i could try to use a snapshot from autumn and it would probably build against 5 3
if we see that it really fixes it it might be worth trying trying a slightly older snapshot against 5
thanks for the update looking forward seing that landing chromium feel smooth again should setting com canonical unity interface text
do you know why chromium does n t turn on the scroll animator smooth scrolling by default errr 0
we did n t er no 1
if that fixes the upower issues i turn it on in oxide and it works great 1
should be ok next cycle though it probably does n t work on something obscure 1
https bugs debian org cgi bin bugreport cgi bug 762579 errr 0
no it can be slow but should indicate progress yeah everything was on schedule 1
go ask if they have a different one depends on new gnome crack of course 0
wimp p well not a biggie tbh 1
wimp p i think the complaint about current fd 0 was that 0 is a valid fd so it s
boo yeah that s what i did change i was n t sure if he wanted another initiliazation 1
yeah you need that should setting com canonical unity interface text scale factor should make unity change the corresponding gtk
expensive was around 70 gbp come join us 1
basically in unity we read the value of a gsettings and then we connect to the signal 1
that s just the belgish word you know our snapshot is quite outdated 0
should n t be too difficult to fix it though right lol 1
oh nice indeed ahah 0
sorry i was out when you pinged great that you found it thanks no it can be slow but should
nice we need to update that all over unity 1
good morning desktopers should n t be too difficult to fix it though right 1
there is a bug open if that s useful for you for tracking is totem still on 3 10 because
well the update qtsystems would be part of the qt5 4 transition great thanks for working on it 1
ubuntu bug 1494240 in xorg server ubuntu xmir crashes immediately on startup using glamor on nexus4 high in progress does
it looks like gles3 uses libgles2 so so it s probably not hard to add a few new wrapped functions
i m wondering why i do n t see that ci train bot ci train bot canonical com thu 03
kevin gunn it might be you have an older kernel and your gles version is 3 0 1
zero result from glgetstringi do you know how to get xmir to dump core on the phone it seems ulimit
it s a xorg thing and i forget yes but much bigger c is still single digit bloat c is
yes it s dumping with a limit of zero from the gl version string 0
zero what the dumping message would come from libc or something userspace but the actual dumping is a kernel operation
yes but much bigger c is still single digit bloat c is often double or even triple digits 1 2
zero result from glgetstringi you just need anyone with appropriate upload permissions 0
ok but that sounds like the correct solution right instead of breaking one thing i m getting your crash now
i guess that s technically true probably not related but also uninitialized memory issues would move with different logic i
this is annoying epoxy is doing the right thing only calling glesv3 functions after it confirms the version is 3
how is mako reporting gles ok 0
does xmir crash immediately when you launch it on a nexus 4 the mako driver lives in android and libhybris
which part is saying it does 3 0 we need to break one of them 0
it looks like gles3 uses libgles2 so so it s probably not hard to add a few new wrapped functions
success it now fails later the same as on desktop with egl why do n t we make hybris export
because it s structured to implement v1 and v2 separately adding v3 under that structure is a very large undertaking
ok but that sounds like the correct solution right instead of breaking one thing then everything will just work right
the strcmp after glgetstringi it would be a silly investment of a large amount of time to implement all of
but also does n t change anything here tis this might change what you see too https bugs launchpad net
ta success it now fails later the same as on desktop with egl 0
it looks like gles3 uses libgles2 so so it s probably not hard to add a few new wrapped functions
ubuntu bug 1494240 in xorg server ubuntu xmir crashes immediately on startup using glamor on nexus4 high in progress not
excepts it s a patch that will never be accepted upstream this is annoying epoxy is doing the right thing
we could modify it to delete the unnecessary redundant and crashing code that would also be correct also i think
yeah but i m pretty sure i know why i ll test and fix that today which code is crashing
the strcmp after glgetstringi it looks like gles3 uses libgles2 so so it s probably not hard to add a
it s an ubuntu specific problem i m happy to make it an ubuntu only patch or generalize a proposal
but i do n t get why we do n t just make hybris wrap glgetstringi so ca n t
and i love how that log message always says dumping core regardless of if if actaually does yes but that
i am going to look into that in a bit i wanted to first publish the voice call blanking improvements

ah but the page does exist p 0
http www kubuntu org getkubuntu download lts ping 0
yes i know like i said the page does exist nothing 0
guess not you do not get a 404 you get a page saying that the page does n t exist
whatever is easier you might want to see if the patch even applies in the current package contents 1
but now the installer is freezing this is why you download the source package with dget then rebuild the source
the package is in a way already a source package or do i misunderstand you re 0
which version of the source package did you pull re 0
could you walk me through the steps to add that patch to the package i asked because i was going
i have also looked at the exact location where the patch applies it looks the same could you walk me
can windows access a ntfs partition inside an extended partition well adding it to the package yourself is one thing
well that s a different process than just patching it for yourself for all we know it s already there
also how many partitions are already on that disk what would you do 1
well i usually dont fuss with libraries and kernel stuff and you might want to check with people much higher
hi kilos irc is a lot quicker but i m also at work so have to look when i can

you may be able to adb pull your home directory when in recovery mode for refernce it is here https
yes there are people here and identify items we should drill into 0

u s s log http pastebin ubuntu com 9840179 started on what 1
nope image 74 is broken the android layer is the bit broken out on the right 0
i did notice that was not correct and was not part of the uri format the way i fixed it
i can add a hack comment to make sure that we deal with it when i click the icon on
okay cool a manual start logrotate should force a recompress 0
ook yeah just so long as we remember to remove it once oxide is doing the right thing i think
haha i ll add udm to that bug sounds good 1
yep otherwise it ll be rejected 0
as far as the code goes otherwise it all looks good to me i m just going to run through
bug 1385464 in canonical system image logrotate fails to run if status file is corrupt logrotate running during reboot high
yeah brian just added it 0
mandel s branch includes a server to run for this but not sure how to run that for a test
if it s something siloable it would be nice to land it together with your fix sure should be done
all looks good if you just update the branch with a comment about the underlying bug i ll go ahead
ack pmcgowan i had 38m of log files and with the updated logrotate upstart job that dropped to 3 5m
verry pushed 1
great approved right now its hard to sort it out 0
ubuntu device flash channel ubuntu touch ubuntu rtm 14 09 proposed revision 81 ok i ll just keep waiting then
the apparmour profile it all to cock bug 1413986 in ubuntu html5 ui sdk first launch of a html5 app
and i thought we were friends launchpad bug 1385464 in logrotate ubuntu logrotate fails to run if status file is
or do n t want to webapp or html5 one 1
ted i asked for filtering by channel and device on that page ah this is not a webapp then 1
dholbach yes in general people are n t supposed to be using proposed and ci does have tests running 0
that should have ended in the first time i open it it spins and does not but all subsequent tries
shall i file a bug about it why would we i think we would like some automation app has crashed
yes please yes 0
you need free devices to run the test and a setup that actually runs it and that needs to be
rtm yes there are people here 0
starts find on first try here on vivid or why that 0

yeah do we have a root cause already 1
i do n t use it much just a bit annoyingly slow when i do have to go have an
right i like it that you are driving most of this 1
maybe the set of tests could be small like does it boot can i do a phone call html5 0
so 10 minutes of tests and then publishing to proposed is just a 1 min switch changing symlinks 0
did i oh i know i did n t take any blame p 1
i was just trying to explain what s currently there or maybe two 0
there is also this awful hack but it works https code launchpad net jamesodhunt ubuntu trusty upstart periodic logrotate merge
thats a question for ci report crashes per minute on each image 0
it s not the bootability check it s the ci infra that is the problem so i wouldnt want proposed
because they consume from that same channel to check tha which should emit errorfound 0
but given how hard it is to change the backend this is n t a one day operation why that
would it be possible to take the same image and boot it in kvm or something beforehand pmcgowan i had
we should add that to the bug report can you use ubuntu device flash to go back to 81 1
yeah rtm 1
oh you did n t fwiw i rsync my entire home off the phone daily to another machine as a

yes sad panda oh 0
dobey we have a chroot agent daemon what keeps the click chroots session active even if you quit the qtc
if you reboot you need to run the script again so go into recovery and 1
really if you can do that and give me an older version of the click to install locally i could
ok in recovery tar up data system data and data user data that s all your data anyway i assume
actually our downloadtracker connects to download error some operations will fail if the acl is empty but now i m
maybe the set of tests could be small like does it boot can i do a phone call it should
what s the name of that package i do n t think have n t checked the code 0
right it is not installed by default on rtm currently 1
in the middle on a long meeting i ll get back to you asap how come 0
i think unless we are prepared to really manage that it is n t useful no worries 1
coincidentally i just mentioned this to pmcgowan if someone could sync debian user conf logrotate conf from lp ubuntu upstart
i need to get a closer look but the single error signal is enough i m not sure that we
can you see that page pmcgowan it s still not clear is actually corrupting thte logrotate status file but the
will make sure it is done asap yeah thats more future thinking 1
when ok do you think it would be hard to have a bootability check for proposed images 0
i m sure systemd has six options for it my wife feels like she s talking to a machine when
wowzers yes unless we arrange for the sys rotate logs event to be emmitted regularly i had proposed to rotate
alternatively you can upload a click that you already have exactly i have t give you the instructions to make
dunno sorry yup you re affected then 1
but even with it working it will only kick in if i restart the session or an app no well
a manual start logrotate should force a recompress phablet ubuntu phablet du hcs cache upstart 0
nope it s on ogra s radar with a crash you mean 1
correct no unit ttests 0
yes unless we arrange for the sys rotate logs event to be emmitted regularly i had proposed to rotate hourly
feel free to comment ont he bug so i need some help on how to get started 0
try deleting the status file and re running then you can fall back to the sdk ppa any time by
i have version 0 1 installed and 0 2 on staging whats the verdict i added rtm tasks to that
people running proposed should always check the ci results before upgrading we need to run logrotate daily 1
i thought we do but the corrupt file blocked it or did i misunderstand 0
right it doest let me boot 0
i still find the staging names of servers a bit braindamaging can you take that bug then 1
thinking if you can wait til snappy leaves me any time to work on phone bugs 1
it is n t useless when they re attached to crash reports dogfooders should use the dsecond 0
as much as i would like automatic and useful crash reports 0
there should be a cron job for this fix bugs 1
ideally so i need some help on how to get started 0
but they arent no it has nothing to do with poorly arch is just that doing jits is hard 0
for applications not yet but for everything else it works great fyi 0
i could take a swing at it just handling the download status right i think you are the only one
joi have 563m have n t done that personally has n t been useful but bdmurray can get you access
yes folks have done reports like that 1
oh until we have that we ll have to settle with managers 1
a lot better now last i talked to ev about this he was working on setting up an analytics system
dunno sorry crash reports on u8 or all 1
any crash report that is non recoverable hum right 0
i do n t know anymore i disabled crash reports since they just kill my battery life how many click
i guess the question would be how could we get more people checking them hello 0
hum right dunno when did you check it last 1
superb for me it was the beginning of this week 1
ted i asked for filtering by channel and device on that page yeah thats more future thinking 0
hi i have a question about this slide https docs google com presentation d 1 ociojmsdili6jdbbuhobkkxdzraaggea esooa5cne edit slide id
think https errors ubuntu com ubuntu touch vivid proposed period day 1
so my concern with turning all logging off would be that we will have access to those logs on automatically
sorry was on call you mean fixing bug 1385464 i ll add the other too 0
indeed my radio was outdated updated lets see if it s better hmm that should be changed in the code
as far as the code goes otherwise it all looks good to me i m just going to run through
right we re all aware that what we have is suboptimal atm https lists launchpad net ubuntu phone msg08514 html
mint touch any tips on testing from the staging server and if any of the clicks have a bad hash
joi have 563m if you can do that and give me an older version of the click to install locally
pls tell me which pkg available on staging developer staging ubuntu com you re going to test this with dholbach
rtm sorry the isp guys just arrived to check on my cable modem 1
no no perms i need to get a closer look but the single error signal is enough 0
alexabreu so it looks like for two folks starting a webapp works only on the second time alternatively you can
ok that one is available to be installed but it s not installed on rtm devel proposed was wondering if
i did a work around inside udm the silo has been tested and set for qa to review thanks for
awesome thanks i do not touch the qtc if it is possible i would not even poke it with a
so it is a matter of time atm we will remove the hack when ever oxyde is fixed that would
that s not on the staging server ack changing the hash 1
this is the script to point the click scope and online accounts to staging usr lib pay service setup staging
just type join ubuntu after running that with phablet shell you need to go to online accounts delete any u1
hello done changed the last char from f to g 1
and please share the ubuntu irc link please i m guessing system settings is n t honoring the env variable
weird i see that network geturlpackage is getting the value from anyone know how to recover after upgrading to 82
i do not touch the qtc if it is possible i would not even poke it with a stick what
qstring command environment value qstring sorry dude i forgot all about the broken image 0
the env vars have the same name as those defines in ubuntu system settings trunk plugins system update network network
devs the first the scope seems to be using a different variable that s set in the sh script 1
that will change next month i hope try adding those vars to that script both in the initctl part and
i have reached here after browsing a bit about contributing to ubuntu wait it s called slightly different 1
yep so it s poorly architected and not threaded 1
oh you did n t must be a way to get it booting again 0
how many click chroots do you have when 0
3 would it be possible to take the same image and boot it in kvm or something beforehand 0
i have a fix just for thet do you want to be a test user d dholbach yes 0
i need to get a closer look but the single error signal is enough ppa ubuntu sdk team tools development
beter than with a let me know your feedback and i ll request a silo etc 0
no need to worry d i am just happy to find some candidates launchpad bug 1413986 in ubuntu html5 ui
and when you see a crash that looks common it is n t trivial to look for patterns like which
you can fall back to the sdk ppa any time by removing that toolsdev ppa it s been enough to
technically it is one deb someone needs to port s disable enable logic to qdebug 0
in 20 minutes or maybe two 1
just fetch the qtcreator plugin ubuntu deb packages and i ll change the hash 0
i read that your voice call are terrible on mako it used to be the same for me i did
but given how hard it is to change the backend this is n t a one day operation why that
i do not touch the qtc if it is possible i would not even poke it with a stick it
is that what ricmm worked on fyi 0
and it does fix it there no 1
or do n t want to does seem a little bit faster 1
what is the diff then just curious great approved 0
dobey we have a chroot agent daemon what keeps the click chroots session active even if you quit the qtc
i look at it from time to time too ok well i approved your check hash branch because it did
making the sdk to start faster was a big target still not a rockstar but getting there it is not
can you look at that before we backport this to rtm ca n t we get that toned down a
on my wife feels like she s talking to a machine when i use it 0
and i ll change the hash oh i guess we need the downloadtracker to emit errorfound 1
how come right now its hard to sort it out 0
i need to get a closer look but the single error signal is enough the first time i open it
actually our downloadtracker connects to download error pindonga nevermind looks like mandel updated the test plan 0

thank you yes but that current xxx unstable 1
kernel faq ah so the patches in that directory were not actually applied 1
the latest mainline added a new dependency for signing oh but they maybe building unstable and getting lucky 0
right depends if you want to build it locally or if a ppa would do if a ppa would do

yep i took a long way to explain it d bug 1496319 in snappy could not create symlink to hw
fine then useless laggy hotel wifi 0
thanks 0
por encimita yes we need that 1
you should ve received an invite the apis in plainbox are not in plainbox public yet but they will be
please have a look at the ux there are you running that in a published branch 0
i tried to make it better than the old script yeah skip those on wily it depends on the mp
ok thanks i ll ping you back in future we might ask that the person signing is owner of the
after you look at the basics i d like to discuss how to integrate unit tests there are two ideas
thanks i ll give it a try after lunch 0
ah well that s yet another good question i do n t know the answer to 1
needs to create a group 0 files matching boot grub a snappy selftest initrd 1 expected 0
what do you think about https bugs launchpad net snappy bug 1500755 and let us know what group that is
and then we add that group to the cla group 0
sure as long as membership in that group implies they can submit code in the company s name something like
not bzr but git you should ve received an invite 1
but at least you could store all the info about that in dconf then p in future we might ask
so you would still use the pre loader from sd but could point to a different uboot sure 1
i even added the missing test i forgot the first time around where you found that fail home john canonical
excuses p 0
i blame zyga i do n t have control after provisioning happens from that point forward it s completely up
question finally got time to finish work on bug 1496319 one question is snapname json additional file content fixed for
btw did you see zyga s branch yeah if that s all then i could possibly let it just modify
por encimita it failed again and i m off to bed 0
it is good because we can autocomplete and select tests specifically or with a filter trade you 0
trade you not bzr but git 1

because of python3 any time 1

thats for current and i think i updated the doc accordingly py3versions 1
i d like to chat not urgent sometime when you re having a better day about rpi2 automation yeah skip
i ll give it a try after lunch py3versions itself crashes 1
publish it and i ll check if it s a real bug or something to fix on the test it
it crashes because py3versions is a dh thing what s the question again 0
and i suspsecy you do n t have that in the stage python o yey btw the os on my
that s great thanks python3 minimal hmm 1
snappy shell and try it maybe i do n t even know what failed 0
bug 1496319 in snappy could not create symlink to hw device with udev rules undecided new https launchpad net bugs
that does n t work we still have some work to do to improve that report it does n t
i got it now but what really surprised me is that udf did n t exit with a non zero

bug 1496319 in snappy could not create symlink to hw device with udev rules undecided new https launchpad net bugs
nope though that s not bothering me so it wo n t cope well if we try to test upgrade
mostly just trying to work around the fact that rpi2 can only boot from one place if i simply remount
yeah skip those on wily it depends on the mp you reviewed earlier yeah i m booting an ubuntu image
so obviously there s a big downside that we do n t actually test the bootloader from the new image
there is rebuilding the oem snap in the rpi2 section on https developer ubuntu com en snappy start but the
but how do i get it back if things go wrong bootchart 0
i need to know that it will fall back to the right place no matter what if anything comes to
guys are having beer next to me though but i do n t think i could point it to the
if anything comes to mind just let me know what your thoughts are ok great worked perfectly thank you 0
which entries end up getting modified when you do an update i need to know that it will fall back
yeah if that s all then i could possibly let it just modify the one on the sd card but
bootchart but it s still under boot uboot a b 1
what s that about if i simply remount boot uboot after booting and force it to point to the mmc
if i echo 1 into it i see a sys class pwm pwmchip0 pwm1 being created you re still up
i rarely go to bed before 2am worse is that i m still working p finding red is a lot
what did you seed i might give you a branch tomorrow with some more prints to understand what s going
bootchart thats for current and i think i updated the doc accordingly 0
you re still up and this is what changed in the image http paste ubuntu com 12617877 1
no but i can publish it well not sure you wnat your drone to be capable of convertingjpeg to tiff
heheh you would need both uboots on the sd and duplicate the uboot config 0
it failed again and i m off to bed dconf i understand but x11 1
launchpad net snappy snappy just feels wrong already how did that package get through review 1
are you running that in a published branch ohhh 1
yeah that s trustworthy and safe group is strukturag already is there 0
is that your ppa or 3rd party hey vmayoral pc 0
if that says okay it is enabled 0
good luck maybe because the one that filled out the cla for the company tells us somehow 0

maybe something is in the private one that would be super awesome 1
also can you fix the broken provides i noticed the same thing in my review p thanks 0
workaround is that if the helper script is n t around and apparmor is then trigger an apparmor reload so
i thought i had fixed that end of last week lem me check oh ha 0

indeed i think the plan is that you ll depend on init system helpers 1
we use the same packaging from precise all the way to vivid just checked lxc does have a dependency on
yeah could be related to cgroup setup which does vary depending on how you get your session ssh vs local
ah i see i did n t realise it was already done and unconditionally too i guess ah yes 0
his dep on init system helpers is for other reasons you should still be adding the explicit versioned dep where
but this test is obviously a sad panda and it s hard to blame it on apparmor thanks i need
ignore who oh but if name resolution is n t working your vpn setup might also be bust 0
nobody i know what s wrong with the lxcfs one we ll need a new cgmanager to fix it though
morning release team i m going to start uploading the openstack kilo 3 updates which have been tested in ppa
i ll keep an eye on it all they have release team acks just pending aa review 0
thanks they have release team acks just pending aa review 0

yeah working on it 1
oh actually they are n t making it through proposed migration they are in unapproved righto letting apparmor in 1
that would be super awesome i know what s wrong with the lxcfs one we ll need a new cgmanager

reah huh weird there s nothing really special about the test environment it s just a kvm instance of a

if you have lock screen then you get the lockscreen spoke to thiago yesterday he s shelving the dbus changes

that d be great it s part of the theme so yeah 0
lol for a day or 2 at least until the next landing d 0
um is the greeter supposed to hide if an app opens there s a branch to go with it now
what if you have a password which actually the test seems to be doing 0
oh i think it might just be that the greeter is swiped away but not unlocked please 0
right thread waits until the greeter is swiped by app open and unlocks it 0
please yeah looks like it ca n t find the proxy or something but checking on ubuntu app list shows
works if you have the greeter open though tsdgeos single will fix the test i reckon 0
i think too but having the unity8 workaround unblocks me and removed a dependency on a different project you mean
i suspect we may want to display your name as we do with existing reviews i do n t have

it s a tradeoff i know and if it s not worth it then that s fair cool thanks 1
no if you enter the password manually while it s waiting for whatever it is waiting for unlocked i mean
you can either update backport those libraries or use the latest archive nevermind i ll figure it out 1

it s possible we re suspending the app before ap is able to get the proxy for introspection this explains
cheating dednick https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source unity8 bug 1446846 comments 2 1
dednick i think the problem there is that we re left with the lockscreen after having spawned the app grr
that kinda works sure but that s always been the way it worked and i think that test passed before
look http vimeo com 126505316 perhaps we need to modify the test it s making the assumption that the app
or we can adapt the test to check the greeter went away and the app is running yeah definitely a
well we can force the lockscreen open but that s cheeting a bit if you have lock screen then you
i think we have the mock lightdm with no password for this use case so the thing is there are
well the test is about opening app hides greeter it s not cheating to put there a greeter that helps
wow so we might finally getting a stable shellrotation ap test what was the fix oh i just realized i
i would go as far as saying that devs must be on the latest devel i meant that it s
so then i guess i should update the docs to say devs must be on vivid no no because having
yup yeah if we d land both as is the merge between the two would n t be tested 0
grep for lightdm in tests autopilot there s others that do it i ll have a look soon ish 0
done i have no particular opinion on what s better 0
can you add unity team to the ubuntu settings components team or that 1
tsdgeos seems we have conflict between silo 7 and 39 that s the way everything does it ca n t
its you lost me there d but that s fine if you know what you re doing d 1
we have 2 silos waiting for qa testing you mean that the import path is the same for fake greeter
you need to set apparently you just grab the latest image from the official downloads and do release upgrade devel
which i think gets all the mocks rather than just lightdm but maybe not 0
yeah yeah you do n t want to build all the deps that updated 0
tsdgeos seems we have conflict between silo 7 and 39 tsdgeos http pastebin ubuntu com 11023987 s 1
anything to lower than barrier to entry thread waits until the greeter is swiped by app open and unlocks it

the other way would be to install a copy of the mock lightdm into a separate path like we do
i think it s ok just answered the email for completion 0
https code launchpad net nick dedekind unity8 fix autopilot failures 1446846 merge 258411 you can either update backport those libraries

i would go as far as saying that devs must be on the latest devel even if they re doing
i could thread it to unlock while waiting for the proxy that s going to make casual contribution nearly impossible
yeah definitely a test issue so the thing is there are many libraries outside of unity which just get updates
but that would n t help someone wanting to contribute new features or fixes i know that backporting those into
it would require backporting mir and it s dependencies too at which point you d have like half of the

good question probably not possible you just grab the latest image from the official downloads and do release upgrade devel
we re still talking 30 60 minutes of work before somebody can even start poking around in the code sure
well you can always build the revision that is released on your system i digged into that for a day
but that would n t help someone wanting to contribute new features or fixes please check i m not testing
its they want to run the new unity 8 probably in a window under unity 7 they do n t

i set elasticsearch memlock unlimited thanks 1
i can understand it took me years before i came to terms with pam or do i have to hunt
all fixed it d probably just be a matter of selecting the proper kernel metapackage linux image generic linux tools
of what sort it s quite common for the kernel to go weeks without logging anything and for a server
not sure why you would want to disable that he had a shutdown notification from root in an ssh session
usually the best notice you get that a reboot happened is the huge logspam at 0 xxxx seconds in the

thanks guys do release upgrade only upgrades the packages that are currently installed 1
there s no distinction really between desktop edition and server edition to the upgrader thanks a lot for teward 0
thanks guys removing the gui portions might help a little but without further details on your environment it s impossible
from apt and do release upgrade s perspectives it s upgrading based on the migration path from trusty utopic vivid
thanks he s installed the desktop iso 1
once you get to needing a preseed file the iso has already been selected and booted he s also asking
so removing the gui bits is not too hard nor is removing the other apps provided he has a list
hmm so then since i start the process using the init script as root let me see what it does

good newer upstream ntpd supports client only modes without gross config hacks though it d probably just be a matter
the kernel and x11 family of packages are newer the 2 kernel will be unsupported sometime in 2016 so you

maybe you should have two sub headers indeed 1
might wait until wily is usable as i pesume that will have 3 16 as default mir support without patches

the listview with the list of slides which has to behave differently according its usage as bottom edge page or
do other apps get location and try restarting the device i sometimes find the location service gets confused somehow it
i guess you want the listview on the left and the presentation on the right in a converged or wideaspect
it did get a reboot for the update feel free to add questions suggestions to the doc the more we
yeah i mean have two headers yep for what i understood of your issue you may want to use ubuntu
so you wo n t have the agps support which image channel are you on but what happens if you
mako stable nik90 here is the header api doc https docs google com document d edit heading h yv1xue68vkeu 0
this basically https docs google com file d 0b3xynhvkfrvmejvpqvhud1j3zwm edit unity 8 is proprietary code so lies 0
which scenario do you need the second header in on phones tim put sample code in his blog post 0
nik90 this is on your concern whether certain components will land in 1 3 or not which one are you
table desktop for the right sidebar we need header actions as you do multiselect and stuff in the queue mmm
in 1 3 so the normal channel has no working gps 1
the ubuntu one is proprietary code free from my understanding it has working gps just not agps no with uitk
so the palette in 1 3 may look slightly different from 1 2 and below how do i see what
indeed but adaptivepagelayotu is specially made to support columns based page viewing not rearranging the complete ui system image cli
it seems to be already possible at least using uitk 1 3 https imgur com g3tbx1y http paste ubuntu com
ah i see so i would put the header actions of the right sidebar inside top of that and not
hopefully that is because people like your app and have no issues with it look at the music app reviews
and i assume you ca n t make them into the actual header bar they would have to be below
what would happen if we replaced the head contents with two of our own header things to contain the actions
yeah i could see us having 3 sections on really big displays like album songs now playing queue yes i
recovery magic out of curiosity when can we expect 1 3 to become a stable api 0
whats up flashing 0
well it is being assigned to looking at the bug report you will have to follow that if it blocks
entered recovery then tried again yeah so songs does n t work for spoken word 0
but say we build a custom component that held the left and right actions which we then set to the
hmmm you guys are stuck between using ubuntu layouts and adaptivepagelayouts since both of them individually do n t offer
supposed that the orange rect is your component something like this https imgur com t4fbznd so you wo n t
and that ll land with the framework bump and ota7ish whats happened 1
heh i m trying to create a custom header for quick memo which behaves like the android flexible header https
yea cuz i don t have the bq stuff if you set no title it hides the standard header iirc
yes it will be no with uitk 1 3 they added a setting to explicitely hide the header but seems
you do header visible false locked true to reflash 0
ahayzen you could have an adaptivepagelayout on the left and anchor your own item to its right side i m
ok thanks i ll surely try in order to see if i can deprecate the custom header i m writing
yes after that we re considering moving the header to be part of the page instead of the mainview then
you can do it directly but in my example i put the item inside so that the item changes height
but where will the header be say i have a random rectangle inside something does that mean the header contents
table desktop for the right sidebar we need header actions as you do multiselect and stuff in the queue well
yes that s right ah yes you would need stages in the header because currently when you release it it
we have recovery ok cool thanks 1
yes which bug report 1
i did do that once just to look at the new api properties it brings but didnt have any sample
butttt nik90 here is the header api doc https docs google com document d edit heading h yv1xue68vkeu 1
ah so your mako has not self combusted would you be adding an api to set the header background color
try ubuntu touch stable bq aquaris en so pageheader header is what i m interested in 1
i ve moved my n4 ubuntu lunaos sailfish android ubuntu lol yes 1
cool i m thinking to make it part of the headerstyle but that part still needs to be worked out
yes header will be something that behaves like a header the hiding and showing but its contents is empty so
pageheader will be a header filled with the stuff that we have now in the header so that s basically
https developer ubuntu com api apps qml sdk 15 04 ubuntu components pageheadconfiguration contents prop did you say further down
yay errors yes something like that but i still have to see all the designs because maybe it needs to
i m about to reflash mine anyway so need to reremember the cmd so maybe the app developers need to
thanks for the feedback it is good to think of the use cases i ll let you know when i
what do you mean exactly there is a lot on that page or at least a pagestack on the left
there is no version of the ubuntu ui toolkit for gtk though so whether your app will be useful on
hmm interesting what i see under flexible space with image looks cool i did n t think of that before
header item anchors bottom parent bottom height parent height parent y image visible parent height 100 https developer ubuntu com
like in https developer ubuntu com static 5f519c74 5718 474e 9196 eea21644bd4a uploads zinnia 100gu right png sverzegnassi i suppose
i guess you could do something like that probably better but that s not very readable in irc i ve
ok thanks i ll surely try in order to see if i can deprecate the custom header i m writing
do we need a item inside header to change its height ca n t we do it directly it has
the androidy one so it is a bit more complex then i thought to avoid the auto show hide 1
pretty hacky though so if we re adding these headers to items or pages or whatever where will the header
trailingactions actions selectionmode selectallaction selectnoneaction deleteaction searchaction can you explain that a bit more 1
but where will the header be say i have a random rectangle inside something does that mean the header contents
which one are you on http pastebin ubuntu com 12202059 so the header will by default attach to the top
so if you have item rectangle header it is inside the rectangle simple and easy 0
if you want it aligned with the item you do item header rectangle nothing happended really 0
there will be two actionbars one on the left for the back action or navigation tabs overflow panel and the
the race is more who can get their solution past qa first currently the one on the left gets 1
you ll still need to build it yourself and most of the deps take a look at this https docs
if you want it aligned with the item you do item header rectangle so in those designs i would say
so the header will have no contents it is for you to fill but what happens if you do multiselect
indeed but adaptivepagelayotu is specially made to support columns based page viewing not rearranging the complete ui no it is
probably the header branch is here https code launchpad net tpeeters ubuntu ui toolkit header3 but that header will be
good luck thanks for your advice 1
ok nik90 just to make it clear we are not going to freeze 1 3 in 15 10 release 1
but i ll do what nik90 said and then reboot nik90 this is on your concern whether certain components will
https drive google com file d 0b6zaaodzfwq2qzhbofpucjzkzwm view usp sharing will it freeze after a framework is bumped or will
true but we are at a unique point in time where phone will not switch to 15 10 for another
the api is more or less stable components are stable as always as stable they can be in certain situations
ack makes sense most likely each framework iteration will contain more and more but shoudl never break 1
all those downloads and like 5 reviews which scenario do you need the second header in on phones 0
do we need a item inside header to change its height ca n t we do it directly yes it
awesome thanks ahayzen you could have an adaptivepagelayout on the left and anchor your own item to its right side
and when those come it would be the same api as now except that you would also be able to
whats happened out of curiosity when can we expect 1 3 to become a stable api 1
ufn we are keeping it but we will announce it like 1 2 months earlier whaaaattt 0
yes header will be something that behaves like a header the hiding and showing but its contents is empty so
true but we are at a unique point in time where phone will not switch to 15 10 for another
so these development frameworks will they be on stable phones eg ota7 or only proposed the scrollable header e g
the stable ota x releases are always containing a stable shapshot of 1 3 they were there since day0 of
true so once we see that we ve released everything we planned to 1 3 and convergence we will call
do other apps get location and try restarting the device i sometimes find the location service gets confused somehow i

btw i noticed mtp s comments about not using exclusive grouping properties on checkboxes instead radio buttons are the way
https docs google com file d 0b3xynhvkfrvmejvpqvhud1j3zwm edit indeed they will be different only visually and yet affect the user
yes header will be something that behaves like a header the hiding and showing but its contents is empty so
so it s kind of a subset of ubuntu layouts i guess you want the listview on the left and
ahayzen and hey we will have a new palette finally some proper semantic color values there normal focused hovered and
we have a palette already do n t we like theme normal selected and so on yeah i mean have
any cool design screenshots to share about how menus look with ubuntu touch styling ack makes sense 0
yes but the coloring is not enough for what we need so we need two more value sets to properly
well i heard t1mp say you cant mix pagestack and adaptivepagelayout sometimes we use lighter or darker coloring for these
so the palette in 1 3 may look slightly different from 1 2 and below can i use gtk as
that would be very confusing to the user having two multiselected states we do n t have yet screenshots but
but first ota7 will have the additional and complete adaptivepagelayout api damnit 0
supposed that the orange rect is your component something like this https imgur com t4fbznd ahayzen so once you have
time to prototype me thinks gnite o 1
do n t have time to look retrospectively to old ones i would say we need the discussion that started
unless support is meant to mean some bespoke custom development on demand type things was talking more future than resprospectively
i agree its not ready but it will need to be at some point you need to find some team
if you are concerned by this i would say raise it to the technical board so you copied the fix
its a little concerning some of it is due to desktop team still holding randsom over g s d g
stupid algorithm yeah nothing i can really do here so when you get the issue and you are stuck feel
code copy i wasnt expecting you to fix it but sooner or later it will have to come that that
except there are teams to support them just not canonical teams so either thats a technical issue that the archive
the issue is also to know that if there is a security problem in one of those packages in 3
or there is no garanty that volunteers are still going to be around or wanting to resolve the issues in
it companys come and go like the wind just saw thanks 0
install it in a live session and try installing sure the big boys will be around will canonical be 1
so i do n t think it s a canonical or not just need to have a solid reference which
the horizon height is imho critical just saying imo commercial backing doesnt provide a huge guarantee in itself 1
i noticed when testing my fix for the battery info key no i argue there needs to be a way
yes for the couple of cases that were bought up https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source unity bug 1433648 0
so in practice there is no real issue no but when you were telling gom will be next up i
if desktop team takes all our mir requests then no like desktop team subscribed to tracker and grilo 0
so on both seems networkish managerish or rfkillish hardwarish it s like the django model you write classes and it
its quite new still so i do n t think it s a canonical or not just need to have
have i ever filed any unreasonable mir s i do n t think so no signatures need to match 0
no but when you were telling gom will be next up i started to be afraid that you were referring
i did not say soon just saying imo commercial backing doesnt provide a huge guarantee in itself 0
maybe did you try with upstart 1
it did n t show up on the list though atleast for now we have got though the backlog of
does n t seem yet from git master then again some of sparql also plays up with sqlite at times
pfff i m in as a side effect laney review on https code launchpad net seb128 unity settings daemon battery
then again some of sparql also plays up with sqlite at times i messed your comment of the gnome contacts
oh yeah keep me posted 1
nope we borrowed the scalemenuitem code for an xfce plugin guess its ok to land first thing in w though
if you want to ask for the uife then go for it ya 0
so i do n t think it s a canonical or not just need to have a solid reference which
approved thanks going to lunch now some of the current direct interaction with sqlite is a bit shonky 0
thanks but it s not even on there yet 0
too late larsu any news of the theme csd decoration look changes 0
mh attente did the internals but i think he did so unsure we can compute valid ones 0
i m testing the combined changes give it a bit to build and i can confirm if it works no
so where s the new api single window sorry 0
laney can one of you maybe review https code launchpad net seb128 unity settings daemon non unity sessions need scaling
that s the new api i guess we cpould n t use uuu before except there are teams to support
i do n t think so tried pinging this cihelp thing no reply yet 0
not up yet trevinho is that something you could easily change 1
is that already in vivid the u g s d part like have a nautilus in main and nautilus tracker
and many times in the overlap case canonical do n t want the new features that pull in the new
i know so we should update them all together well there are solutions 0
why not what we can sync with that 1
seeing the number of bugs issues that i heard about it not sure it suits main though please do 1
if you think the benefits are worth it sure 1
yeah nothing i can really do here so when you get the issue and you are stuck feel free to
no but i can open one if you want i was just checking if i find one not well vertically
joke apart i think the qa team should review the tests even if this seems to be trivial i m

laney review on https code launchpad net seb128 unity settings daemon battery info key merge 253336 appreciated as well lol
ok if you could give a size budget of 4m that would be helpful too it companys come and go

is there a new wallpaper or are you gon na kill me with off set one and all of the
why not were you more concerned about the horizontal alignment or both horizontal and vertical 1
i wasnt expecting you to fix it but sooner or later it will have to come that that tb if
honestly just find the person who drew it direct too late 0
if you are concerned by this i would say raise it to the technical board i quit canonical last year

sorry in my personal opinion upstart is very unintuitive to use systemd make much more sense to me and is
i also totally second daftykins suggestion of starting with the minimal installer if you really want a minimal system it
truth is that i always found linux too complicated so i always feel like a newbie it is always been
upstart is poorly documented and also not finished 1
the only thing particularly different about this system is virtualmin which installs a plethora of stuff some of which are
maybe i dont know i have n t had to do anything with it in a while go sort that
is it possible that it s just a backlog of queued jobs i would n t call that poorly documented
in addition to irc there are 3 other venues of support for ubuntu specifically ubuntuforums askubuntu and ubuntu discourse since
now just need to learn how to use ubuntu the main ubuntu channels require that you speak in calm polite
oh thank you and sorry all guys i did n t want to bother here with non tech speaking the
apache is running so not even 8 boots right now 1
it just adds some features like easily moving the mouse in out of the windows sharing folders better graphics acceleration
enter the efi setup and check windows boot manager is the default boot choice that should at least restore 8
probably some of your packages come with new dependencies and as a result a partial upgrade is needed to install
then cd and then if you re root mount mnt qnap backup else sudo mount mnt qnap backup http paste
if efi is like the bios there is no option for windows boot manager this is an ideapad z560 v3nd3tta

there are none as amd dropped support for that series of cards release 12 04 1 emphasis on 1 still

or you could try using something web based run it and pastebin the output 1
a dist upgrade will install new dependencies for packages already installed and may remove packages if they are no longer
things differ it s called a partial upgrade before it does more than updating your already installed pacakges 1
you are right but trust me i had ubuntu on it ada yang dari indonesia 0
yes which version of ubuntu upgrade updates your pacakges dist upgrade performs partial upgrades do release upgrade upgrades your ubuntu
sure i just thought you meant you lost the boot option erk i think you need to start from scratch
i think somehow i installed ubuntu onto one one the ntfs partitions is that possible and daftkins again thanks very
either removes or adds installs new pacakges unfortunately that s all i know about gnome music it just seems to
nah the file system does n t support linux distros just one 0
wait i bet the 200gb extended with no fs is where ubunto lives and when io was trying to fix
yeah 196gb lurking there perhaps maybe you will have a problem with ne process itself just type killall process 0
heres dist upgrade http paste ubuntu com 10864224 right so again why are you using documentation that is way too
ok it s gnna remove a pacakge that s why you got the partial upgrade prompt window that error message

if you mean you want the screen to auto resize when you adjust it then you need virtualbox guest additions
if you read up you d see that s what the installation of is being discussed you should try https
i am trying to install them but not getting anything ubuntu shuts down very fast on computers this is normal
iocharset handles displaying special characters no install the guest additions from the virtualbox menu of the running vm 1

as of right now there there is n t one everything i tried failed so i removed i do n
what shared file system type is your nas offering oy vey 0
there s a possibility of it being that way for any os well i think we re going to need
it looks like the module i need is there not sure why the alias is n t working for it
though honestly since systemd is replacing upstart in the very soon to be released ubuntu 15 04 you re probably
ubuntu mate 15 04 because you dont have a hardware crypto device 1
ok so you want a samba cifgs client installed on your machine and you want an example mount line for
probably because it s a very old guide nimms nothing happens 0
you should n t need to touch modprobe it should all already be running in your current kernel by default
the only thing not in either of those two guys is how to have it mount on boot is that
thanks now how would i find the mount point 1
i asked about the mount point p just explain your problem to the channel 0
try sudo apt get install f f flag fixes things correctr no os is found when i power on the

or without v for faster and again with v to confirm after it s done hi xangua yes both are
though honestly since systemd is replacing upstart in the very soon to be released ubuntu 15 04 you re probably
rsync is more reliable it s what people who value their time use well there you go reinstall them from
but never used ubuntu before the difference between rsync and cp is like the difference between apples and moon rocks
thank you just please confirm that the packge downloaded by sudo apt download would be a deb packge correct 0
but to summarize cp will copy all files you give it period rsync is smart enough to if you tell

yup appreciate it 0
i would just do that no need for the extra step i ll restart 0
why ports and is your network bridged uh what s the error you get from rsync 1
like we said you should be going to the qnap with rsync and forget about mounting the cifs share first
use chown recursively sohail ahmed or is it apt download i forget the exact syntax 0
i do n t have a desktop on the ssh once can t it s a cifs mount 1
well i wanted to set it up on a schedule if i do it directly most of the time it
it s from a desktop but if i were to restart or the power were to go out it would

ok right i m having a look nope and it s actually pointless by now we can safely remove it
a friend is seeing crashes but he s running mate so could be related i ll ask him to file

still trying to understand what happens listitem and listitemlayout are resized correctly but loader does n t follow them as

per the doc that s supposed to happen automagically how is this bug going on https bugs launchpad net ubuntu
but then if i trigger height 1 then loader picks it up and it updates correctly i would have expected
listitemlayout resizes correctly listitem follows correctly it is loader that does n t resize if you need more help just
just rectangles as if the item resizes before loader connects to item heightchanged 1

i wat to test silo 34 but it is building against some libraries from proposed universe libphonenumber and enabling this
from what i understand wily is sort of in a bad state anyway with the gcc5 transition being kind of
i was under the impression that wily images are just outright broken even without silos yeah it s already quite
re stating the question you sure a source copy is required not a binary one need to know since making
hi we could try enabling proposed on a case by case basis is there a branch that s giving you
o nice i do not intend to release it until we can test with the new wily image 1
ok it s disabled you can try a new build lp timeouts for me a bit hm 0
yes the requests page and the dashboard have a remarkable amount of overlap i would consider merging them into one
you re welcome are we low on silos 0
ubuntu qa i now top approved the mp in https trello com c e44qrpq2 2179 168 ubuntu landing 023 ubuntu
is there a landing call today yeah you just run the build job as usual 1
there s no new train only the spreadsheet was replaced the new web interface is just a dumb data store
heh mixing old wily image packages built with current wily release pocket sounds like a world of hurt ack 1
would be good to have for ota 6 yes particularly since it contains the fix for find in page which
you re welcome thanks for letting me know a source copy please yes i want to make sure we pick
yeah i see it appeared now did you press assign again to reconfigure i m surprised you have a phone
no worries i am using a previous version 1
heh mixing old wily image packages built with current wily release pocket sounds like a world of hurt i think
i tried without proposed but it fails iirc it s built with proposed 1
if you do that you ll need the ppa reconfigured to use proposed again ok i have just reconfigured 0
it s in the json too he just asked for that 1
thanks i got it 1
just for development and tests i tried without proposed but it fails 1
is that channel hidden it does not appear on the list query device krillin list channels ack 0
maybe do n t worry this wo n t happen to you http arstechnica co uk gaming 2015 08 nintendo
i am getting this error channel ubuntu touch devel proposed g 5 not found on server https system image ubuntu
hmm so i think we need to have vivid phone builds only go via citrain then i am flashing with
hi we could try enabling proposed on a case by case basis is there a branch that s giving you
worked thanks ok well i ll disable it for now but i do n t think we can publish the
yes i got same result as the proposed image it get suck on bq screen 0
thanks hi was on lunch just reading now 1
do n t worry it s just the first time i ve been assigned to a landing so i was
thanks yeah i saw michi e mailed you and he was still on complaining about it when i got on
he just asked for that you re welcome 1
so maybe you just missed it or it s a bug not me personally i have just seen several people
re stating the question you sure a source copy is required not a binary one need to know since making
i did n t see if anyone else asked specifically to have it enabled rather than just complaining about it
deb http ppa launchpad net ci train ppa service stable phone overlay ubuntu vivid main debug sure i just wanted
thanks ack 1
gosh i have way to many things on my plate to remember that the ppa needs to be in the
hmm we d lose not just the ubuntu community but also all the technical support and infrastructure we have here
i know im so excited ah ok yes that is fair enough 1
infrastructure is not much of an argument infrastructure is 99 server resources bandwith actual cpu mem power space that s
debian seems to do fine so does every distribution that is n t fedora suse ubuntu but backports is separate
seems jono is with the community it s just come to my attention that the cc is community elected 1
well according to the wiki it s appointed by shuttleworth and then approved rubberstamped by vote if anything that seems
sensible server 0
what version number did you use http paste ubuntu com 11393543 what do you make of this 0
done for the package first line in debian changelog 1
generating a lot of heat lovely for your ppa upload change that to 4 4 10 0 0ubuntu1 ubuntu15 10
most have been but some are still running on plsama 4 if you look on the ec2 you can see
that s fine the e mail is picked up earlier in the build so a nc wo n t clear
generating a lot of heat digikam is a beast and contains lots of parts and one of those parts is
4 4 10 0 0ubuntu1 ubuntu15 10 ppa1 4 is an epoch which means the version number got screwed up
for a complete build just run debuild or debuild j4 where 4 is the number of cores on your computer
and how does it get pushed from my ppa into main archive but to make the source package just do
you can browse the cmake output near the start of the build log file to see if there s anything
yes we were gobsmacked missing build dependencies mostly 1
ok lem me do an update digikam is a beast so the cmake output is pretty complex 1
cat digikam source changes yes is n t that what gets made 1
because it s all part of the ubuntu archive so we use the same version number conventions for the same
it built for clivejo in his ppa but i did merge in one more change before i uploaded so it
who wants to take over the kubuntunetbook twitter account how s digikam doing 1
debuild j4 will clear out all the compiled stuff compile it again then make new deb files from that yeah
i find most of those weather apps annoying and clunky got a screenshot yep 1
so this 5 9 is your number not the maintainer ok source packages signed and ready 1
the package i uploaded built ok awooga 1
error uploading files for distribution unreleased to ppa not allowed i hope whatever happens re drama does n t put
i ll shut down the ec2 if we re done with it what i do n t like in kubuntu
what option exactly do we need for such packaging http aws amazon com ec2 pricing i m sorry for their
1 apt install libkf5wallet5 5 9 0 0ubuntu1 libkwalletbackend5 5 5 9 0 0ubuntu1 0
riddell gave me the first lessons and then it was a matter of trial and error and not giving up
15 10 is in development so needs the packages brought up to date what work does it need then 0
oh beep beep beeping beep i m on 15 10 1
we already have packaging in kubuntu ci so just bind the right repos and branches http anonscm debian org cgit
no but it s listed in muon it s not from new you should package from the branch in git
and it ll get sent to launchpad main workstation 1
no this my media sercer pc with 2 hdds one for testing the other for a stable os add what
i find most of those weather apps annoying and clunky got a screenshot fancy packaging kamoso https mail kde org
it should it is indeed 1
its just an example im looking to get some experience packaging new releases 0
seems to go wrong from here qmlplugindump could not exec usr lib linux gnu qt4 bin qmlplugindump no such file
possibly which release clivejo 15 04 1 apps have been packaged and in testing stage2 for some time know i
we already have packaging in kubuntu ci so just bind the right repos and branches http anonscm debian org cgit
it slowes way down the nearer it gets to 100 almost as bad as windows disapointment at what 1
is this the package i should be updating we already have packaging in kubuntu ci so just bind the right
digikam was n t done i ll take your packgae and upload to ubuntu 89 0
i think the patch for dolphin wrt places is in 15 04 1 i had the bug on watch on
ah no those particualr two are not done ok 0
https paste kde org pjkixobya applications 15 04 1 is in a staging ppa and needs checked over digikam is
so aye let me know if you want to do kamoso ah that was going to be my next question
seems to go wrong from here qmlplugindump could not exec usr lib linux gnu qt4 bin qmlplugindump no such file
ah yes nobody has done it yet 1
eta for 5 3 1 in backports but backports is separate from wily there s already branches for backports packaging
to give it a final eye over and make sure the release and version numbers are right 2 out of
ok so these are not ready for prime time thanks i will look into it purpose or kamoso 1
i ll shut down the ec2 if we re done with it start with purpose 1
when places are closed i click on the icon for the root of that place and i get that how
someone did n t comment out a loop or something somewhere d component universe 1
uh kamoso 0
debian thinks it is wrong that the phononcmake config declares the relevant import target so they simply made the dev
i guess i never see you aggressive in the channel since i use kubutnu so it s 9 years i
that is where i do all my packaging let us know when you work out what questions you have 1
you made the orig package for the package first line in debian changelog 0
because it s all part of the ubuntu archive so we use the same version number conventions for the same
that s the version used by the daily build we have to make up a version number for that and
but just ignore the current stuff in debian changelog and make your own entry in it state failed to build
yes use what upstream is using https twitter com 0
ultimately it does not bode well for someone like myself who is interested in taking part well spotted on kaccounts
and how does it get pushed from my ppa into main archive where did you learn this stuff 1
pastebin apt cache policy libkf5wallet5 apt cache policy libkf5wallet dev do you keep the library separate 0
pastebin is digikam not a kde app 0
which did n t build that version is in vivid updates you must have installed it from there then removed
yeah shadeslayer kci back up 1
oh it was down i have been running many jobs it needs the branches merged with debian first 0
ubuntu 15 10 pastebin more context 1
thanks palasso it would be generous if you did 1
which format can you explain to me how to fix it holds up newbie white flag 1
sure let me see what s wrong and the kde version still shows 4 14 7 0
ok so since kgeomap is n t built anymore the gpssync plugin is n t either so the icons in
i could and that would fix it but i think that s wrong me too 0
devs as in kde devs not us if you tell me what else needs testing based on what was n
there s a libkgeomap source now http anonscm debian org cgit pkg kde applications libkgeomap git log h for example
it has already been packaged https launchpad net 7ekubuntu ppa archive ubuntu next stage2 sourcepub 5098778 listing archive extra i
http tinyurl com p8hf8f6 great digikam needs it to build as is is it ready for upload 1
is it a free one or paid for package should be ready but it ll have to go through new
http paste ubuntu com 11397383 this is what i ll push to the packaging branch and upload git clone https
anyone know how i can tell which kde apps have been ported to 15 10 i seem to be stuck
alas reality xd there was a change in bzr that was never uploaded so jonathan took that and your package
i can fix up digikam for the time being assuming there are n t too many more moles to whack
yes is n t that what gets made ok lem me do an update 1
i m planning to install kubuntu on my dell laptop hoping my experience there is as good as my desktop
ooh kubotu s working that bug bleeds over into okular when opening a file the places list is the same
even if they wo n t exist for another 6 months until wily is released both are 4 14 7
is there a better vcs for me to push the digikam commits to than https code launchpad net kubuntu packagers
lol yeah but digikam should n t be using it 0
looking should be in git but it may not be forgot that was one of those extragear things eta for
ok so after playing with dolphin a bit i can add a new place but the more places i add
15 secs this time before i could use it it loaded and displayed properly let me see if i can
i even found a ballot in my old email i never saw before yup from next stage2 1
bug filed and assigned to you to update digikam once libkgeomap gets in in which case we have some kubuntu
kamoso needs packaging now along with purpose library and there s some packaging branches available for daily builds but they
ah yes possibly which release 1
i hope whatever happens re drama does n t put you off your efforts on kde kubuntu should i add
yeah wait a few i need to see if this file is happy first before we bother testing ok im
hi clivejo it is in testing now 1
i reverted to 4 14 12 3 0ubuntu3 which is vivid and the bug remains maybe ppa purge did n
i have a sneaky suspicion we may need to go upstream with this i will let you know ah ok
ok so after playing with dolphin a bit i can add a new place but the more places i add
ah it ll need the build depends updated anyways so i ll go ahead and comment up well 15 04
the version on dolphin is 15 04 0 should n t that be 15 04 1 next stage2 package ok
that s different from debian where for some reason they upload the source with a deb and the build server
i m not rushing you friend just trying to provide information that ll help d apologies 0
try the option for networking if you back at the menu what does rfkill list say do you see anything
why does apt get tryes to install old kernel verison what wifi chipset are you using 1
i am guessing you edited etc udev rules d 70 persistent net rules that error i have n t seen
that error i have n t seen before yes i did 1
sudo nano file that would be your wire 0
ctrl x of course 0
http hastebin com pafolodudi pl or kdesudo kate file 0
depending on the amount of data and such well hard block is usually due to physical switch but can also
do you know your network settings so again what chipset is it 1
so the hard drive is dead what does lspci k grep a2 network say 1
at least it got solved d i have a question regarding kubuntu i recently installed ubuntu onto my main laptop
http www omgubuntu co uk 2015 08 plasma 5 4 new features it is stable but it is never recommended
thanks well it s clear that by running a beta i am peeling off the warranty sticker but i feel
sure just a sec can you send ctrl alt f2 to the vm 1
damn run sudo apt get install f 1
kde share config plasma desktop appletsrc it says it s read only can not create file 0
so i recently discovered the ultimate solution to my dual booting headaches i can try logging in through curl 0
do n t jump to solutions investigate the problem first why is that 1
well just for missing entries ip l s eth0 up 0
true dat in a terminal pastebinit mount and give us the url it reports 0
make the former ntfs partition an lvm pv create or add it to an existing vg and use the space
qualcomm atheros ar9462 wireless network adapter rev 01 d too true 1
if the windows ntfs partition is the first 1 2 of the disk and ubuntu is at the end the
damn if the system is n t currently using lvm you could clone it over into the new lvm config
if the system is n t currently using lvm you could clone it over into the new lvm config using
when there s existing partitions its much easier to reallocate them to lvm than to try shuffling existing partition data
sudo vgdisplay ahhh thanks unit193 0
it s not lvm p but the new swap will get a new uuid so your etc fstab will be
xd if the windows ntfs partition is the first 1 2 of the disk and ubuntu is at the end
im a total idiot yep 1
is it mounted ro but can likely be started 0
no idea how do i mount it as rw if it s not usually the reverse is better 0
sudo unable to open var lib sudo ranveer 1 no such file or directory check mount to see if it
ok so what errors do you get when you try to create a file you should be able to see
tell us what smartctl says about you drive in a terminal pastebinit mount and give us the url it reports
damn could you pastebin the output of sudo smartctl a dev sda 1
sithlord48 tj thanks i tried to fix the partition using a bootable drive and it worked ok on my phone
i d still like to see the smart output try the option for networking if you back at the menu
damn i ca n t sudo it now shows rw relatime errors remount ro data ordered 0
you should be able to get a root shell through the emergency mode right i can try logging in through
es yeah 1
that would be your wire open a root shell through there and then run the smartctl command without sudo 1
then i press ctrl d where it boots into kubuntu and i ca n t do anything with it alright
smartctl ai n t installed it s now back to rw though still in emergency mode 0
temporary failure in resolving urls sudo nano file 0
cool cool but can likely be started 1
so i recently discovered the ultimate solution to my dual booting headaches of course 1
setting up a wired connection is a lot easier so please do connect it hello 0
hola done what next 1
run ip l s interface name up nope 0
what intefaces does ip l show try the option for networking if you back at the menu 0
alright i m in recovery mode ip l s eth0 up 1
why is that ok dhclient eth0 1
nope error getting authority 1
that does pretty much the same as above sure just a sec 0
i know run mount o remount rw then run mount to confirm 0
arggggh what a fool i am that error i have n t seen before 1
do you know your network settings hmm i suppose you have no internet connection wired or wireless 0
nope not really beta2 0
you should be able to get a root shell through the emergency mode right hold on 1
run mount o remount rw then run mount to confirm reading back yeah sounds like a drive issue 0
desktop it now shows rw relatime errors remount ro data ordered 1
so hardware issue eh that is good does the dhclient command work now 1
you re welcome nope same error 1
before you restart k 0
then it s not gon na take very much time at all did it remount ur drive as ro 1
ok it says it s read only can not create file 0
this application spawned a sub window which is decidedly out of view use the openbox option it d be like
kubuntu kubuntu lordievader i now have systemctl installed what next 1
then go with sithlord48 suggestion tell us what smartctl says about you drive 1
we want everything outside of the monitor areas completely 0
how do i do so kde share config plasma desktop appletsrc 0
sithlord48 for desktop images i just use some pics from my own files 0
make a backup now sure on it 0
of course so the hard drive is dead 1
it doesnt even have its taskbar entry so i cant even move it it ai n t dead but it
so hardware issue eh this is hard it has the wrong keyboard language since nothing is right 0
it says it s read only can not create file https wiki ubuntu com wilywerewolf beta2 kubuntu 1
so will my do release upgrade currently transpiring on this machine go ok lol yep 0
networking may be off while in that mode in the end i found alt f3 helped 1
nice we do n t cachce var spool plymouth and var lib plymouth though 0
can i assume that netboot would be good to test in the meantime also 64bit uefi secureboot amd64 netboot under

i also do a desktop run from usb on real hw too 1
o install server i m doing it from mini iso instead of being in tty with a login prompt i
virtualbox thing ftr the album synth pop is awesome for testing to 1
also 64bit uefi secureboot amd64 netboot under way and burning 32 bit too the live session does n t start
we fixed casper to actually show plymouth during shutdown i guess that exposed that plymouth bug there ll be another
i also do a desktop run from usb on real hw too not effecting netboot though right 1
no it s a ubiquity fix from the live session only no squashfs errors 0
the live session does n t start when selected from dm i ca n t install the dvd on the
cool i ll carry on with netboot then i ll do a desktop and server install here and wait on
ok i m doing some non english tests and verifying results for server not effecting netboot though right 0
this does work on ubuntu and xubuntu now this error message looks like it s trying to access something from
ftr the album synth pop is awesome for testing to where is the code that does the caching 1
ubuntu mate puts it s plymouth themes in lib plymouth themes ubuntu mate logo maybe i can submit a merge
it s in bin casper stop in casper flexiondotorg did you figure out rebuilds this morning 0
i thought by now we d cache pretty much anything from plymouth but it looks like it s still missing
indeed i thought by now we d cache pretty much anything from plymouth but it looks like it s still

i tested stock ubuntu approximately 30 times yesterday when fixing the x gets stuck on reboot bug i see this
fun i can test a dvd here i ll burn one 0
you can just boot the live cd serial console debug automatic fix for all woes 0
iso in a virtualbox vm understood 1
how s the actual install looking we should get the same if you merely start the live system and shutdown
we fixed casper to actually show plymouth during shutdown i guess that exposed that plymouth bug stock ubuntu just spat
hm i m definitively not getting that in qemu or on real iron so this issue maybe specific to virtualbox
cyphermox has this same issue some days back in a test release of casper i was testing for him virtualbox
for completeness http imgur com fslbpik ok has a memory 0
back in a few are you testing an iso or from an usb stick trying to see what s different
o iso in a virtualbox vm 1
will report back later emulated dvd drive 1
davmor2 we tested an usb stick on real hw worked there too 1
which i do n t like i m testing real hardware and real dvd s just call me mr old
davmor2 no i m grateful for that 1
i also do a desktop run from usb on real hw too normal to lts is probably ok with prompt
any idea why a server install defaults to tty7 but tty7 is a blank screen with just a flashing cursor
if i install and restart the squashfs errors occur popey emailed me 0
what do you see exactly x going down plymouth the hit enter text emulated dvd drive 0
sure from the live session only no squashfs errors 1
hmm i m not sure off the top of my head you might be able to u64encode it perhaps as
i do not see a press enter to eject media on either live session reboot nor at the end of
i assumed as much just double checking i ca n t install the dvd on the system but i can
i also cover the 3 major gfx and 2 major cpu manufacturers too d booting to live session from dvd
so this issue maybe specific to virtualbox although some of the jobs failed but they were n t test failures
i actually help test implement that with the kernel team and cjwatson yeah looks like it 1
i ll install vb here and cross check but need to sort out two other things first ok so under
sure brendand can you make the review for ken s branch or pass it to federico if you wo n
if you have anyhting the needs testing just ping me lets see who s vanguard 0
how s the actual install looking ubuntu mate does have plymouth themes 0
ok so under vb plymouthd does n t listen to dev tty7 and thus neither prints text nor receives keystrokes
yay 1 is fixed and will be in next build 2 is in progress 0
stock ubuntu just spat out the squashfs error just like ubuntu mate i ve ask the oem to test on
will report back later i have release manager rights but have n t requested a rebuild before when i hit
ok so under vb plymouthd does n t listen to dev tty7 and thus neither prints text nor receives keystrokes
back in a few ok has a memory 1
2 can not be fixed at this point but there is a workaround i ll upgrade the release notes we
the virtualbox video device id is now blacklisted from grub cool i ll carry on with netboot then i ll
i also cover the 3 major gfx and 2 major cpu manufacturers too d i actually help test implement that
maybe i can submit a merge proposal http changelogs ubuntu com changelogs pool main g grub gfxpayload lists grub gfxpayload
related virtualbox thing 0
some good news and i tested xubuntu today s daily this morning 0
no i m grateful for that so we ll try to entirely disable plymouth on live system shutdown this is
any idea why a server install defaults to tty7 but tty7 is a blank screen with just a flashing cursor
for path in which halt which reboot etc rc d etc default which stty bin plymouth lib plymouth lib plymouth
as in do the install reboot the system and you are stuck in tty7 as to a more precise timing
thanks just removing the call to the other test makes things more stable but yes i agree that probably it
yes but so many things can be happening as we discussed the test is too big so it s hard
not yet i m trying to find the bug i filed with steps 0
some good news more bugs coming 1
there are 2 bugs currently 1 session does n t shutdown restart on vbox 2 live session does n t
can we attach to a row in nfss a subunit stream file oh so only little things then nothing major
not yet nothing really 1
1 is fixed and will be in next build 2 is in progress 2 can not be fixed at this
i386 just needs to die that should fix it right i would need to take a look at the code
not effecting netboot though right http people canonical com pitti tmp py 1
just need to build new images when the new ubiquity lands so the try option works hmm i m not
ah right yeah an important question normal to lts is probably ok with prompt lts but the last one looks
service openvpn status says its running check var log auth log of the server you re trying to log into
are you speaking to me i use 443 too we need to see if it just died randomly or if
sorry my internet was disconnected hence the https 443 0
yes to pass the censorship tls error tls handshake failed 0
it means that the program is n t bound to that port possibly because it s failing to start ok
how can i start it manually to check if the problem is because of that i tried restarting the service
tls error tls handshake failed can it be because no one is connected to it 1
usr bin openvpn config name conf and you ve already restarted the openvpnas service 0
may you explain more is etc init d openvpn start different from service openvpn start 0
that is what i got from the init file true 0
then i can not give any advice read the guidelines how can i make sure its running 1
with netstat ntpl command no there is just python and sshd service openvpn status says its running 1
does ps list it it should n t be illegal on this channel too 0
what is ps i found this tls key negotiation failed to occur within 60 seconds check your network connectivi 0
ps report a snapshot of the current processes see man ps i m looking at week old scrollbacks and see
yes what should i do 1
may you explain more why should n t it be running now 1
ps aux grep openvpn does that return anything ah perfect do you see the service listening on port 443 0
when i stop openvpn service its the output why it ai n t claiming the ports read them and see
i ve set verb to 6 im going to check again does ps list it 0
what should be my first step in diagnosing why i cant ssh into my server all other services are working
tls error tls handshake failed i will do something myself 0
i do n t think a server should try and setup an ssl connection that ll come when a client
http pastebin com qdaihxgy ah perfect do you see the service listening on port 443 0
precisely the point launchpad bug 665235 in cloud init ubuntu grub legacy ec2 attaching a volume to maverick instance may
i do n t think a server should try and setup an ssl connection that ll come when a client
oh it says so in the error page heh ok it has soon built for all archs but it ll
you should ask nicely in ubuntu release i guess even if cyphermox does publish it s up to them whether
was not also needed a qtmultimedia opensource src gles package you re welcome 0
yes i ll upload it soon too is mediascanner used in the desktop in any way 0
great okay 0
okay much more than in the previous run http people canonical com bzoltan ap vivid silo31 krillin main ap vivid
but i m not sure the difference is actually meaningful aha ok then 1
i see lots of failures in this log http people canonical com bzoltan ap vivid silo55 krillin main ap vivid
what will i need to do once it s all done just re approve the branch thanks should be the
no just rebuid the failued jenkins job would be enough it is initctl start unity8 that s failing although maybe
you are in the queue that requires re approve 1
agreed on that the only suspect log line is ap trying to start the x11 input method instead of uinput
it is initctl start unity8 that s failing although maybe only because of testability being on that reads like a
o i m just getting a clearer log this one was a result of previous failures 1
so messaging app and telegram will need it for sticker support i think i m starting to get what s
ok we changed the internal structure of unity8 to support external monitors so this check is wrong now 1
i guess the packages there will be copied over when x starts no problem i just served as your duck
thanks fwiw could sometimes use them for testing 1
quitter before that the uitk ap tests were broken but the logs are here http people canonical com bzoltan ap
lem me look support for mpris controls i think xavigarcia knows more 1
no just rebuid the failued jenkins job would be enough yes just mpris controls for phone only 1
16 wily i see i do n t think it is crucial for the desktop tbh 0
i do n t think there s anything dangerous the webbrowser app ships a profile based on easyprof but it
i tested it on the desktop before testing it on the phone you have money to burn buying the next
much more than in the previous run http people canonical com bzoltan ap vivid silo31 krillin main ap vivid 031
how much do the deps the actual package weight you mean in silos 55 and 16 0
as per the bug report 960kb the package itself is 70kb there are 32 failures it worrying 0
yes but uitk has nothing to do with them you re welcome 0
as you see those are not introduced by the silo055 gim me 5min please 0
those are failures since longtime we are working on to make them pass but they are broken tests and not
but there are many failures for ubuntuuitoolkit tests it is in universe i do n t think there is a
thanks if the logs say that same on archive then it means that the failures are not new 1
ahh i see i would n t ping anybody in there whoevers around tends to watch the irc fairly closely
flakiness good morning i need some help to upload http people canonical com abeato qtmultimedia opensource src in silo 16
not fun no just rebuid the failued jenkins job would be enough 0
so what s up with these yeah no fw bump i think 0
ok looking if rhe archive tests fail without the silo then i do not care 1
here s an example vvv log from a working and broken test run http pastebin ubuntu com 12860476 no the
but there is a chance that a regression was introduced in the archive that sounds like a big job 0
it s release on thursday so i am worried about breaking anything with no time to fix it and the
if the regression was introduced in the archive then it is a problem of whoever it introduced and probably would
people should do the same testing as i do sorry for the noise back to the drawing board 0
i m talking about ubuntuuitoolkit tests with the uitk test plan i look for regression 0
as you see those are not introduced by the silo055 but i can not do much about regressions introduced between
it is in universe i do n t think there is a problem to upload it to wily there are
there is nothing new about those failures much more than in the previous run http people canonical com bzoltan ap
see the previous landing http people canonical com bzoltan ap vivid silo23 krillin main ap vivid 023 before publish happens
yup i see 1
before that the uitk ap tests were broken but the logs are here http people canonical com bzoltan ap vivid
i do not mean that those 32 failures are not problem but for sure they are not new problems diff
agreed on that it is initctl start unity8 that s failing although maybe only because of testability being on 0
those are failures since longtime we are working on to make them pass but they are broken tests and not
with the uitk test plan i look for regression but i m not sure the difference is actually meaningful 0
by the way i found something weird this morning on today scope in rc proposed i tested it on the
tell me okay thanks 0
so what s up with these the sign becomes big when scrolling 1
wow no just rebuid the failued jenkins job would be enough 0
diff looks legit i guess is that intentional 1
when it is near the title bar was not also needed a qtmultimedia opensource src gles package 0
sorry i was answering to osomon ok 1
silo 55 approved and about those 32 failures i am pushing to fix them buy the next landing 1
ok thanks thanks 0
ok you have money to burn buying the next release 1
the stable phone overlay has a wily pocket https launchpad net ci train ppa service archive ubuntu stable phone overlay
right this adds the backported playlist support also to wily i guess the packages there will be copied over when
are the changes dangerous sure ask osomon to add it 1
and the possible regressions are marked as real regressions if they fail twice with the silo it is in universe
here i thought you had special access the thing is that wily is being released on thursday so people are
i used to but not any longer ok it has soon built for all archs but it ll take up
trainguards hey are silo branches available somewhere before they are published hello 1
but there is a chance that a regression was introduced in the archive hey man you still have core dev
perfect would you mind publishing silo 18 for me please then 1
i see it is it will unblock mediascanner which is stuck in proposed 1
well then nevermind i will open a bug if i can reproduce it the thing is that wily is being
yeah this is super critical no problem i just served as your duck 0
can you publish silo 18 please is mediascanner used in the desktop in any way 1
yes i ll upload it soon too oh ok well if it s an important bugfix that affects the desktop
i would n t ping anybody in there whoevers around tends to watch the irc fairly closely as per the
if release does n t accept it where does that package live then yep just use whatever is current 0
some overlay 0
is that intentional yeah we can copy it to the stable overlay ppa where it ll be held until wily
ok great yeah i guess that would be a valid feature request sometimes i also want to see how it
hope to fix that soon too by syncing gstreamer versions across vivid and wily or i could just do it
yeah the more we can do with dual silos the easier it is to manage everything i realise you are
exactly yeah we can copy it to the stable overlay ppa where it ll be held until wily 1 opens
robru ok i ll edit the card silo normally we do n t have any code that relies on a
nod oh you wan na backport wily s gstreamer into vivid 1
the mediascanner team needs this to get mediascanner from being stuck in proposed yep 1
should n t be too bad robru ok i ll edit the card silo 0
thanks hey can you recommend someone to help debug an autopilot issue 0
you re welcome it is in universe i do n t think there is a problem to upload it to
yes but uitk has nothing to do with them one sec 1
thanks yes i ll upload it soon too 0
nod i ve just passed 19 but noticed something fishy upon further examination can i un approve 1
yeah trainguards hey are silo branches available somewhere before they are published 0
oh indeed there s an upload from 4hrs ago and it s no longer in proposed i would n t
ok i ll merge yup 0
sure thing the silo is now merged to trunk so it ll be included in whatever the next release is
ok will try tx wanted to ask you about your take on the kde dev and the community council struggling
they might rename kubuntu and use debian instead of ubuntu they ll keep kde that gives me shivers thinking about

yeah i would argue wait b c engineers are gon na ask did you get a crash file so vivid
that s super werid is n t a crash file generated anyway 1
multiple locks get you a discount on home insurance maybe that true i guess it does n t have to
also when attempting to launch the app it gives it 10 to start successfully well at the end of the
i suppose there s always polling is apport running or diable apport processing like you say not that i m
does apport go bung kk 0
hmm no i very seldomly try out unity8 in a desktop laptop machine i m almost always working with it
hopefully we shou d n t be having too many crashes and when we do if apport hangs as well
but will double check so at this point i do n t think the linked bug is related to autopilot
if my concurrence helps in any way after checking the compiz logs i see that it failed to load opengl
is n t a crash file generated anyway can i ask you to file that bug with your thoughts and
s it s its is n t this bill s bug 1
oh perhaps sorry we were talking about this the other day hence me bothering you sorry p without my patch
yes this is the place well it s not a launcher related test that fails 0
whenever i try and log into a unity8 mir session lightdm just makes logging in anywhere impossible and i have
make sense you know what s up 1
yeah that s really just a hack for silo0 hmm no i very seldomly try out unity8 in a desktop
damn thanks anyways that way we can backlog it and get something done on it 0
i ll try to reproduce give me a second could you push a new version to the store for a
o for funky values of upost 0
mvo also what s up with https code launchpad net mvo snappy lp1480248 test reenable merge 269176 mo in what

dholbach that is strange stage packages are downloaded and unpacked during pull i think i m closer i downloaded all
yeah i think i found the issue 1
give me 5min to verify it seems like its downloading and building when it really should just download should be
i m not sure how that will help me unfortunately i push a branch 1

btw is there a calendar entry for the snappy clinic mvo sorry i was out of office i ll look
i ll take a look at test reenable branch iirc there s other disabled test that we should be able
yes he s invited no like hello world and those i m not sure which have alias 0
well i dont mind if we skip today albeit i have missed last week so perhaps you want to sync
what s project contact in cla asac is often triple booked so i would n t worry about his avail
sure joining now trunk has two revs that are not in 15 04 0
could surely be phrased better hah dholbach has 1
well he added the exact cause to the mp perfect 0
you can via the rest api though that s not a problem with webmail 1
dholbach i m not seeing it where was it no i do n t think 0
it s a new suggestion examples from snapcraft 0
look it up on the web do n t be lazy because they re in sync only because disruptive changes
good morning nope 1
clobrano if it is showing up on launchpad i think it should be fine i ll try to reproduce give
the 15 04 we want to release is in edge now it is n t 1
looking good is that a valid summary that step is manual unless i m very mistaken 1
i dunno i d like to get daily updates then yes 0
well we do daily builds in 15 04 edge and in rolling endge dholbach i m not seeing it where
ah found one fixed it i think rolling edge 1
ok nm sudo ubuntu device flash core rolling channel edge developer mode oem pi2 device part device pi2 0 15
we have a systemd unit that runs it every n hours right but if it is not even tested to
wily you mean we do n t guarantee a boot on edge though 1
if i understand correctly the recipe for lp snappy 15 04 puts the vivid version on the ppa which is
i restarted the service in 180 and now it seems fine depends on how fast the archive admins and rtg
well if i wo n t get pwm today there is no point to upgrade i ll stick with what
the 15 04 we want to release is in edge now yeah 1
or chose a different dev pkg with pkg config support for funky values of upost 0
i wouldnt hold my breath for landing today ok i ll bug chipaca or maybe tedg 1

what do you mean how is it triggered can you please report bugs for the issues you are getting 0
thinking let s just let tarmac give it another try ah yes just not in status 0
waiting for a few other changes before i can build an image yeah i added the environment variable and cleaned
p chipaca i was testing snappy and i got a message like another snappy is running does it really do
that s such a stron word p that means resubmitting your untar perms fix 0
maybe i m missing the gpg key okay verified it works 1
o can anyone easily give me the right commands to get and build the correct image 0
i think sergiusens polished the code to support that recently so yes and because mvo is in pre sprint rush

sure feel free to write that down i wonder should we pull in davidcalle in these calls in the future
will see later yup and that works i get an image that i can dd and the rpi2 will boot
i am trying to build my own image and the instructions for doing so do n t work do you

yup and that works i get an image that i can dd and the rpi2 will boot which should be
and we want them in the release right i see the latest merge but now i m confused why do
well i guess he already knew p because they re in sync only because disruptive changes have n t landed
were you able to get the pkgconfig tests to fail locally and because mvo is in pre sprint rush so
i just need one with no alias to show me an update trunk has two revs that are not in
and we want them in the release ok 0
right someone needs to move the commits over asac mvo ogra davidcalle can we move the community sync half an
if so we need your update qualified name backported to the lp snappy 15 04 rerun the recipe and ask
ahead of you should be but that something fails chipaca but lp snappy 15 04 right not lp snappy 0
ah ok does it look in the current directory for what is specified by the oem flag 1
the 0 15 pi2 sanp is in the store though oem pi2 should work as well adt run setup commands
indeed feels like i have some basic misconfiguration which i do n t understand i can build godd again so
or chose a different dev pkg with pkg config support i m super busy with some customer stuff i ll
yeah i added the environment variable and cleaned up the long lines ack 1
any reason why you dont use the pre built image really cool idea btw thanks 0

i ve verified all the points on your release notes i m happy with this release ok so it s
yeah that cn do it i m not sure how that will help me unfortunately 1
looking good is that a valid summary it just recently started mattering for me due to looking at how to
could you push a new version to the store for a package with no alias wily you mean 0
what it shows as merged branches do n t match with the rev which package 1
anyone from our examples i got some extra homework i m not sure i can get to it 0
examples from snapcraft hah dholbach has 0
no like hello world and those i m not sure which have alias or is that different 0
or to link to it oh it is easy to check 1
will show them but why not upload hello world to your own account 1
unless you are talking about an automated tests hey clobrano 0
i can build godd again so i do n t care mvo and his project names no i think that
it should there is a packaging bug he needs to fix 0
there is n t one oh right 0
i m not sure how that will help me unfortunately not from the commandline 1

it should give you service and security logs didnt you just say it works 0
re messy fwiw i like the separate logs command for that reason status is different than logs imho but he

ok thanks 1
ah great is the worker using this too collabora was extremely welcoming saturday was a day of some very nice
no worry flushing in a sec had a very good entire week in fact 0
yes i dropped the worker logic for finding the latest image and moved that into the setup script i do
that was part of generalizing the worker to get along with any virt runner not just lxc and ssh feel
yeah that s bug 966480 i do n t think it s just uefi installs yes 0
feel free i ll help however i can nice 1
i suspect you do n t have a way to virtualize the tpm bits ie vtpm on xen sure 0
there is a qemu project to virtualize passthrough tpm but it seems that there s no progress there and it
i do n t see the press enter to continue on amd64 vivid on a secureboot and uefi install full
i would think tpm would count as expert would it need libtspi or would that be in partman crypto instead
for the setting up of the tpm i do n t think it makes sense to put that in partman
so if the work is in partman crypto i should be able to test that with a text based install
if i modify partman crypto that would ideally go upstream to debian do you know how receptive they are to
note that i know next to nothing about tpm i do n t see why it would be a major
do you already have the commands steps you need to do this listed somewhere ok thanks i ll try and
awesome feel free i ll help however i can 1
from the ui ubiquity i was thinking there d be a checkbox button for when you do the luks setup
if i modify partman crypto that would ideally go upstream to debian do you know how receptive they are to
so yeah a would be all in ubiquity i have my whiteboard at https docs google com a canonical com
actually the debian installer source package seems very light on content is that where a setup tpm module would go
yeah that s bug 966480 i do n t think it s just uefi installs we have a pretty strict
but it does n t contain anything secret from the ui ubiquity i was thinking there d be a checkbox
i would think tpm would count as expert hw detect looks promising 1
sure for luks that makes sense but you were talking about general tpm setup which implies that somewhere outside encrypted
if setting up the tpm for use does n t require any prompt and is n t going to break
we have a pretty strict policy about not asking unnecessary questions in the installer if every machine with a tpm
sure the no superfluous questions thing applies to d i too 1
i do n t see the press enter to continue on amd64 vivid on a secureboot and uefi install full
so yeah a would be all in ubiquity for ubiquity i do n t think we currently have any hidden
though we manage it in d i by making hard useless questions be low priority so you only see them
i would think tpm would count as expert libtspi i mean 0
you can have questions with dependencies awesome 0
if setting up the tpm for use does n t require any prompt and is n t going to break
means you ll need to fix things up in d i itself too to originally setup the tpm what will

ok first i don not understand how click can put a library under usr are you sure about that one
do you have a copy of the click package but it not 0
do you mind sharing it so i can look and see what is going on yeah just trying to get
all the components of a click package should have relative paths so to have usr is odd to say the
ok first i don not understand how click can put a library under usr are you sure about that one
try placing the shared lib in usr lib linux instead iirc is set as the parent directory of the bin
i m not sure it goes under that path with the standard template it should go under opt click ubuntu
noted cheers have you changed the template or qmake pro file 1
usr is a valid location inside a click package so it will get resolved as opt click ubuntu com package
but if you stick to the template it should just work tm actually opt click ubuntu com vuk maxvanceffer 0
if you change the install path you ll need to adjust accordingly do you have a copy of the click
it is correct for a standard template qmake file though ah i might try that then d 0
you do n t have your path in that list at all yeap 0
but it not have a close look at that list none of them match your install location of opt click
this what see qml engine opt click ubuntu com vuk maxvanceffer 0 3 lib arm linux gnueabihf bin usr lib
you can share it but i m hopeless with pro files have a few questions if anyone is about 0
yeah but as i can see from docs must be adjusted coorrectly that s why i stick with the defaults
have your checked what the deafult qmake templates do ok cool thanks for answering mcphail 0
there are various ways if you re happy to break your device you can make the system mount writable and
eeek i knew it was pretty broken but i did n t know about battery drain good news is i

ask away often not many people here on a saturday morning though have a close look at that list none
yes littel bit there are various ways if you re happy to break your device you can make the system

might be wothwhile getting used to it before breaking it though ahayzen thank you 0
ok will try to explain to click that my lib must be placed inside opt click ubuntu com vuk maxvanceffer
of ten the safest way is to apt get download a package dpkg deb extract it and copy the binary
if you are ssh ing from the terminal app it will be closed you can install an app called tweakgeek
in the open store rather than the default store you have to sideload the open store 2015 12 04 20
but tweakgeek tweaks are currently killing my battery so be wary there are various ways if you re happy to
you can also activate an ssh server on the phone and that runs quite ahppily in the background no it
to restore you need developer mode for adb access 1
or have we passed the point of no return do you have the journalctl order 1
ya i have cairo written down could it be that 1
i was about to say so it can be the qemu issue 1
or have we passed the point of no return see i m copying the lightdm service 1
it s used instead of gedit no i mean could this be triggered simply by the fact that the tests

yeah seems safer to me in the vicinity of london bridge anyhow 0
i was concerned it would also affect lightdm service but it actually has n t so far yo 0
actually systemddm service is the service that is the most activated in the tests you ca n t remove systemd

ok uploaded ifupdown with that hack now fyi 1
thanks hopefully someone did n t fix it manually can verify there s 0
no i mean could this be triggered simply by the fact that the tests start stop systemddm very often speak
i ll start a thread on the uk mailing list hey seb128 0
we draw a trick on touch to keep it out of the image removing it on desktop would remove ubuntu
yeah i have it on a list did you try testing that patch on the bug 1
i was going to propose that no since teuf commented saying it does n t work for him 1
yes you can keep using upstart that s what ubuntu touch is doing yeah i think the nm in vivid
no you can boot with upstart a single time or permanently upstart sysv that s going to be supported until
heh the fact that it sees there is a lxc bridge and whatnot should n t be affecting attempts to
k testing appreciated 1
k too late 0
if you upload 3 16 0 yes needs some discussion anyway 0
bonus point if you upload the new stable 3 16 or find somebody wanting to do that the patch may
you mean if there s no etc rcs d k networking then re enable the service thanks 1
is it a know issue that sometimes notify osd wo n t disappear not much as these are loaded by
update rc d disable will create a k networking symlink instead so we can tell apart that case and not
those damn windows not know then 1
why did you need to use that option at all are you sure you client is not buggy and keep
check the dbus activity to make sure je vais bien aussi merci 0
my pet bug is bug 1422096 if that s not on your list or is maybe a dupe on the
also i m not on 10 1 yet no hurry thanks 1
that means it s going to be in vivid hum impacting all tests do you think it s not a

usr bin unity scope loader applications applications scope applications scopes scope commands scope removing systemd complains policykit 1 depends libpam

make sure it s all installed and in right paths looks plausible same metric for both interfaces 0
indeed libunity so 9 not found but it in usr lib linux gnu ah i ll append it after service

i ca n t install that installing unity settings daemon would break unity no worry 0
morning 0
under the rain hm i made a typo passing auto deconfigure before seems to have worked now 1
why did you need to use that option at all guest session is not scaled 0
hey desrt thanks 1
and no activating jobs any more thanks for testing 1
reminds me of 1436330 morning all 0
i can if you want though my pet bug is bug 1422096 if that s not on your list or
no luck yet everything is pointing me at this being a physical problem with the device so i have submitted
stable channel is the most tested might be a regulatory thing too 1
delete local share evolution and then reinstall qtorganizer5 eds and then try calendar app both to some degree they might
congratz 3 how s it going now yeah 0
that sounds like another good option i started with linaro as my first point of call to be honest you
the source is at https launchpad net ubuntu terminal app you can build an armhf click and sideload it also
because hardware manufacturers are not up and up on the whole open source love thing yet well with sideloading i
yes i did but i did n t know how adb push terminal click tmp 1
that is assuming you just un favourited it rather than physically removing it try port ubuntu touch any clue on
that sounds like another good option i started with linaro as my first point of call to be honest thanks
thank you then the swipe up is the manage scopes 1
i give up i ll go higher up the chain rather then forum based community support nice 1
by carrier settings are you talking about apn can you kill settings and try again 1
glad to see it s possible to get it works can y ou please file a bug 1
sure thing what project is system image dbus in the wiki should mention this 0
thanks yeah that s not a bad idea 0
what you running that on okay so the apn for internet according to the store is net icew ca 0
there should be a library that provides it looking at u c c wait nooby question what s sdk 1
the ubuntu sdk add this ppa ubuntu sdk team ppa why not package not found 0
so the sdk is a developer tool just trying to understand the system omg after rebooting i got wifiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii 0
just got delivered to me yesterday installing the ubuntu sdk also installs the qtcreator ide along with other developer tools
i had nothing that i do n t have elsewhere have n t used evolution in a long time because
i just looked at your error log i am not sure it will work not on android on ubuntu it
is it possible to set a system wide proxy oh howcome 1
i presume it has the web component beause emails are html and whatnot can you follow the instructions on https
because thanks nik great info 0
thanks no add it against ubunut system settings 0
hmm it runs on my laptop without any problems i am on 15 10 but that should n t matter
would be sad to not make use of the cache partition at all anymore do you by chance have bzr
hmm i did n t realize it was a system level setting one sec that s interesting have you activated
do n t have bzr i ll try installing that missing library dependancy and then install sdk and see if
ok give that a shot linaro definitely does n t do front end ubuntu ui stuff 0
but the alarm sounds are not exposed anywhere it seems thats insane 0
it s working with bluez5 on wily with bluez4 on the phone it s working you need to validate the
jesus you have me stumped here i can tell you that now it s a strange event unless we have
that s me i have a ticket in with bq gave them all the relevant info waiting for a response
in france we uses some channels that are not the same as in usa that seems correct to me i
but hopefully reflashing to 4 4 4 then back to ubuntu will fix your issue however there are drawbacks to
do i need to reinstall ubuntu touch after done the fastboot flash radio radio mako m9615a cefwmazm 2 0 1700
we do n t ship a compiler on the consumer phone image itself to me events not equal alarms they
cheers pal even if it s a bugger off i would still be happy to go through the motions and
so we have no control of this today i will enter a different bug them you can mark that one
once you include the container stuff libreoffice true i suppose then the calendar app should take note and set a
first time it s doing this for me too maybe i ll ask over at ubuntu for this and come
no add it against ubunut system settings ok 1
mms port 8080 do you have eds installed 1
because nope do i need it 1
to provide container chroot execution damn should i reinstall evolution and then try again 1
yes iirc maybe try cleaning up the eds config files first i need to quickly check where they are usually
i had nothing that i do n t have elsewhere have n t used evolution in a long time because
you could maybe try the company name as the apn usr pass then go for it 1
is there a separate ppa for qtorganizer i ca n t install it just like that trying to help them
why not package not found no thats all fine 0
new thing then kill evolution process and then remove local share evolution and then start calendar not sure to understand
s but that oh my god it works 1
by carrier settings are you talking about apn wait how does it have some of my accounts already and how
check the system settings app and see if you added online accounts there oh wait its not friday yet 0
london se1 0su calendar app integrates with ubuntu online accounts 1
4g antenna alone will cost about 100 euros you re right thanks for the help 1
4 4 4 should be fine any of those would be really just 5 x is what causes issues np
that sounds like another good option i started with linaro as my first point of call to be honest anyone
after 4 4 4 the ubuntu device flash seems to take less time than when i was trying to go
no to upload click snappy packages 0
still the phone some time freeze and today scope is broken most of the time any luck 1
http www wisecorp co uk wisedevice html it s working with bluez5 on wily with bluez4 on the phone it
there should be a library that provides it looking at u c c in case it matters i am in
ty 0
but when i did it a second time it worked we were using libgnome desktop 3 dev 1
why not package not found okay 1
linaro just does low level hardware stuff i guess you could use some linaro arm stuff to build a phone
however there are drawbacks to this approach though if the user sets a long custom sound as the default alarm
is ubuntu phone is like android with foss apps mixed with proprietary closed sources app gmail right that s because
yeah our new iot cloud router switch and future phone os i have been trying to find out that information
https developer ubuntu com en snappy however i think some of the container infrastructure will be rootfs based and also
4 4 4 4 2 4 4 3 4 4 4 yeah that link that pasted 1
i guess you should ask in ubuntu forums still i m thinking i need ubuntu for dev apps for ubuntu
okay i m installing ubuntu touch on n4 too did you talk about this https developer ubuntu com en start
are you talking about ubuntu touch stable ubuntu and ubuntu touch devel ubuntu right we did n t try that
just got delivered to me yesterday it s an image closer to what is on the bq devices but for
i have no idea but the place to ask about forums is in ubuntu forums iirc have you inserted there
ubuntu bug 1489389 in ubuntu system settings ubuntu does not handle failure to respond to reboot request on update install
i set it to use custom and put the setting in they said no user pass do n t know

thanks 5 0 1
jesus you lot do n t win eh i am pretty sure it had 4 4 on it when i
i ve seen that happen once ages ago that was over a year ago though 1
linaro just does low level hardware stuff i guess you could use some linaro arm stuff to build a phone
i guess the here app might be proprietary not sure let us know 1
i will that s me i have a ticket in with bq gave them all the relevant info waiting for
just switch to voice input p 4 4 4 should be fine any of those would be really just 5
dobey i m in a right pickle here though mate i would have to create another account just to send
not sure to understand the joke but a foldable phone with three displays http www wisecorp co uk wisedevice html
you can install the terminal app from the ubuntu touch store not a joke if you had android 5 x
pairs but hopefully reflashing to 4 4 4 then back to ubuntu will fix your issue 1
aha and there is an update just to be sure you are using ubuntu touch stable ubuntu or ubuntu touch
see you i m using neither but i m special and i wouldn d advise using the channel i m
qtorganizer5 eds stable 1
thanks hello everyone can anyone tellme why there are two build for mako nexus 4 0
not on android on ubuntu it is jesus you have me stumped here i can tell you that now it
not a joke if you had android 5 x and you were able to successfully flash the device you re
throwing rock here did you test conecting to a wifi from android i d suggest flashing 4 4 booting to
haha you know 1
you do n t technically need ubuntu do develop apps for the phone but we do n t build the
it s certainly possible to compile all the bits on other distros though oh howcome 0
also did you try to disable 3g as those frequencies do n t match up the sdk creates a container
ok the people in ubuntu app devel might have better info on the sdk side of things though 1
so the sdk is a developer tool just trying to understand the system see you 1
it s all good here going to be a very humid day again i think ooo back to bonnie scotland

i tried ps ef and top to try and kill some processes desktop session was still all frozen what system
i m on kubuntu 15 04 after dist upgrade so nothing more to upgrade this guide is for plasma 4
yay now i have an oldschool amiga boing ball for a button do you connect the display via dp 1
not kubuntu but maybe kde anyone here 0
yes i am running kde i guess it could be because you uninstalled but regardless you should run sudo apt
what graphics card and driver do you use it is 5 3 2 ai n t in launchpad 0
nvidia gtx760 and 352 21 application menu not lanuncher 0
yes no plasma 5 is still under deveopment and it has to integrate with plsama 4 and some syncs are
right now it looks like i have up to date 5 3 1 from kubuntu backports ppa 0 to upgrade
it does really make pidgin look more dated than it used to look try a dist upgrade 1
a day ago the menu did work ca n t really recall if i was still on plasma5 1 but
i m on kubuntu 15 04 after dist upgrade so nothing more to upgrade hi i am unable to use
the kinfocenter is telling me 5 3 1 imho that blog is simply wrong i was on 15 04 but
i am finding that kdocker helps a bit but i ll need to reprogram my brain to hit minimize instead
do you have any experience connected with that so far from my personal problems i think that s understatement it
in my case i just got fed up with 15 04 and returned to debian jessie as my main os
but as you lxde may be a good alternative too hi all 0
so you expect the 5 to get up to it over time i had difficult time already with 4 but
thank you soee user error i was using launcher agreed i m not sure what the timeline is with plasma
its in the kde git fair enough 0
but that problem do not exist on dvi d interface yes i saw that but there s no source deb
kubntou 15 04 download it from their git 1
the kinfocenter is telling me 5 3 1 imho that blog is simply wrong monitor is connected via dp 1
right but a 30 40 buck nvidia card should work source of plasma desktop v5 3 2 https projects kde
it is 5 3 2 ai n t in launchpad thank you soee user error i was using launcher 0
part of 5 3 2 seems to be in the staging ppa though yeah the underlying technology the tray is
monitor is connected via dp 1 8 i do n t expect those things to update in minutes i was
on alt ctrl f1 it wo n t be this week the kubuntu team is at akademy 1
sorry for getting your hopes up i should have realized that url was bs thanks for pointing me in the
np i tried to google for a short while to see if there s some plasma5 roadmap or some design
the kinfocenter is telling me 5 3 1 imho that blog is simply wrong as lordievader mentioned a lot of
cool i ll try that i guess it s just not ready enough for 15 04 yet 1
hi i just upgraded to 15 04 and i m having some problems with system tray icons currently the skype
for me it s always recognized the other disk but that was with bios supported systems this is my first
yes ok but you have fix for it 1
s number is 347602 i saw some code that appears to be a fix in the website 1
either install it via muon or run sudo apt install kdepasswd from the terminal i m not sure if there
what bug i think there s a patch do you mind guiding to apply it to sources and recompile 1
what is the issue maybe i can help maybe sorry i m not familiar with this 1
that s alright thanks though is there any way to have a setup without a de that still looks nice
alright got ta reboot and double check these settings you can try asking on kubuntu devel or kde devel 1
cool i ll try that i am finding that kdocker helps a bit but i ll need to reprogram my
yes and no it gives me a window with a small list of appearance options but nothing to do with
it s done says there are 111 packages that can be upgraded maybe worth checking https help ubuntu com community
hmm this might be what i need i feel like i m onto something i hope hi i just upgraded
seems like my problem was a bit amatuerish i just started linux 2 days ago i ve had good luck
hi on 15 04 1
hi that s odd unless the devs have dropped writing drivers for the 7 series cards 1
i saw a 8400gs for 30 bucks on amazon a few weeks ago which one in particular 0
kubntou 15 04 new in the sense that it was n t used but probly been on the shelf for
heh well i got an issue with kubuntu 15 04 they do n t even show up in the system
yeah the underlying technology the tray is using did change and i guess pidgin thunderbird and xchat are all kindof
on alt ctrl f1 not to try and force you to change what you prefer but is there any reason
i do n t have any good reasons for xchat it s just what i always used and i would
yes and no my monitor dell u2713h enters power saving mode after alt ctrl f1 0
well first up the simple stuff make sure that kdepasswd is indeed installed i tried ps ef and top to
no worries unable to locate package kdepasswd 0
is there a dmesg error at the time of the switch to read only afw would it make sense to
afw would it make sense to dump the complete output of one of the machines no there is no log
whcih does make it confusing when people talk about it but the whole hwe stack thing is confusing in general
and then what happens the filesystem reports a full error and moves the filesystem r o yes i believe so
no errors the filesystem is in read only mode so every service that tries to save files is down alright
it is a simple webserver nginx apache php fpm our http requests can not be delivered i do not believe
we have tried multiple backup strategies all fail and the weird thing is the centos inside the cluster is doing
i now see that there is a difference between centos and ubuntu the ubuntu machine is using etx4 while centos
no errors the filesystem is in read only mode so every service that tries to save files is down could
could you or whoever ran into that bug do an apport collect 1408833 on the affected host will do is
no errors the filesystem is in read only mode so every service that tries to save files is down to
when you say it goes read only what makes you say its read only if we have no diagnostics saying
also make sure we know what kernel version we are talking about in the report ok when i was logged
and yet the end of dmesg output does not indicate it going read only it was never fixed on 3
could you or whoever ran into that bug do an apport collect 1408833 on the affected host could the filesystem
no i think our best bet is that there is a kernel diagnostic at the end of dmesg if you
right if you just reboot it wo n t get flushed to a permenant file if it had gone read
but i stopped fighting that battle a while ago alright so while being in the read only i should immediately
i will do that and see what the logs say but i stopped fighting that battle a while ago 0
for sure as the end of that might indicate something kernel side triggering read only what data that apport collect
i do not know hyper v well enough to know whether it freezes the filesystem heh yay for useless monikas
i think the hyper v host sends a signal to the guest machines after backup other something like that i
info task rs main q reg 605 blocked for more than 120 seconds what could that mean no i think
will try to do that the problem is the randomness it is hard to reproduce the issue last time last
do you have a vss agent running in ubuntu odd indeed 1
could you file a bug against linux for me and i will ask someone who has a hyper v system
ubuntu bug 1408833 in apparmor broken postinst test for uvtool libvirt on utopic undecided confirmed sounds extremly crazy to me
not as of yet but should be soon i think the hyper v host sends a signal to the guest
yeah i was just thinking about it for the reasons you said for naming that 14 04 2 as well
but 2 had the utopic kernel on yeah that is one reason i am wondering about the freeze bits but
but we never see any log before the machine goes into read only filesystem those logs only occur during backups
yes at the moment is is 3 13 0 52 generic sadly i know next to nothing about vss backup
i would also look at whether the backup is requesting fs freeze as there is definatly a hyper v interface
afw during boot i see also the following message init plymouth upstart bridge main process 298 terminated with status 1
how long does the backup take btw across all the nodes thank you 0
the backups are not simultaneously it takes 1 hour to backup all 4 machines in a row afw would it
afw would it make sense to dump the complete output of one of the machines do you have a vss
yes i believe so heh yay for useless monikas 0
usr lib linux tools 3 13 0 52 generic is running thank you 0
let me check that i have not found any logs of the vss daemon before usr lib linux tools 3
including whether we think it is read only or not that picture frightens me too 1
and scsi scan inquiry result too short 5 using 36 i do not see any hv daemon logs 1
because boot being ext2 and it not supporting freeze was an issue for a while i do not believe that
ubuntu kernel team meeting today 17 00 utc ubuntu meeting hopefully i can give additional information afterwards 1
anyway thanks a lot so far but 2 had the utopic kernel on 0

that implies a task is unable to finish in the kernel danwest the fix we applied still seems to be
thanks for the update i ll review the bug again jjohansen apw danwest reports https bugs launchpad net apparmor bug
thank you heh yay for useless monikas 0
hmm now i am having doubts i believe i did not look at dmesg while the system was in read
right if you just reboot it wo n t get flushed to a permenant file if it had gone read
14 04 2 is n t useless it s just wrong for people to claim it relates to the hwe
could you file a bug against linux for me and i will ask someone who has a hyper v system
also https msdn microsoft com en us library aa384589 v vs 85 aspx is a little terrifying the server iso
well that depends on how you define 2 does n t it alright so while being in the read only
on any up to date trusty host will tell you it s 14 04 2 for sure as the end
are there any news about build of that kernel you told me ahh good point 1
what kernel you have installed is irrelevant that picture frightens me too 0
that picture frightens me too yeah i was just thinking about it for the reasons you said for naming that
yeah 14 04 2 is a point in time in the archive the only relation it has to hwe stacks
i will do that and see what the logs say hwe is confusing i still do n t truly get

patch the patch is usually a good start winter does seem to be bringing them all in 0

more important is that you run the command in the right directory you can do patch path to the patch
and have some legal disclaimer no other output before that line 0
can you join ubuntu discuss in everything 0
more important is that you run the command in the right directory cd to your kernel tree but that begs

i have a weird driver issue which causes gnome shell to hang if it does send a bug report it

the reason i wanted to add info on this bug is because this xorg crash triggers a relogin without the

originally i was going to fix this in the autopkgtests as a hack but then it just seemed obvious to
dunno maybe i was cleaning up test failures launchpad bug 1424769 in virtualbox ubuntu virtualbox guest x11 uninstallable with mesa
anyhow tested and does what i expect for both old and new triggers darkxst not sure how would i check
ok i d rather not be hasty with changes here it s quite possible that pitti or someone is already
it s blocking one other package and now that i know the root cause i could let that package pass
i d highly prefer to have pitti review this before upload i do n t want folks working at cross
darkxst i am just trying to up my karma or at least my subconscious is but the only other place
have you seen the bug report to be fair i just skimmed but i do n t actually see anythign
did you upstream the fix the patch has no header but i think it impacts upstream as well since fedora
though it would actually run more often than the trigger ahh the upstream bug is an enlightening read 0
i d been chalking the swift failure up to the tests do n t systemd correctly until i got annoyed
ok cheers fwiw i feel like i did hear something about this exact issue recently but ca n t pin
i would n t object to the skip the assert if ppid 0 bandaid i do n t think but
but yeah i would n t doubt it s come up before you d need to boot with sysv instead
any reason for the preference it s more performant as a trigger i do n t know the package much
someone might install a non deb package still using update rc d to register the init script so not exactly
the trigger worked fine in my testing but i guess the non deb thing maybe applies i figure that s
i m not super picky about the solution mind you but i do think it s rc for both vivid
have you seen the bug report thanks i ve pinged him 0
yeah i read the report just now i would n t consider my inotify argument a blocker upstream at all
upgrade refuses to add remove packages right fair point 1
i agree about the rc ness of the bug though bug 1438520 in cloud init ubuntu cloud init on vivid
one could perhaps argue for both the trigger and update rc d involvement to catch both not normal package cases
we removed most of the init scripts in the past the rcness imo is only for it misbehaving with debian
the only way to catch them all would be an inotify watch in systemd itself which i assume you d
sarnold i had root owner group on launchpadlib not sure why i am guessing the first time i ran pull
it s difficult to find the correct source package for a given binary package the apt cache show grep source
does it actually cache init scripts that would be insane i assume it just maps an internal service to the
but why it does n t finish initialization next time it runs so changing them should work fine 1
i could be wrong but the idea that it s caching etc init d seems insane the problem will go
right ahh sure it would n t catch changes to lsb headers i guess ive seen crash reports on errors
does it break the sysv init script bug 1440166 0
ok thanks should i always use dist upgrade instead of upgrade then but that s a small and unfortunate corner
sure even tomorrow would be fine so the kernel module will be available on debian too 1
you d need to boot with sysv instead of upstart or systemd and under systemd sysv init scripts are ignored
btw do you know dpkg file triggers and conffiles can you used safely nowdays dude 0
define safely i think there s still a chance overtriggering but i ve not noticed under triggering i guess there
that s basically saying a modified conffile wo n t get twiddled on upgrade so wo n t generate a
but that s not the case i m triggering for if the init script is already there i do n
i agree it would be nice if systemd would pick up the new sysv init script automatically tseliot thanks so

we can cover both of those and then we just miss the non packaged and non update rc d case
yeah sounds about right and please keep me posted ok i hope this can be fixed soon i ll write
yeah they do n t have that bug do any of your team have carte blanche within reason to upload
ie fails because of hows things get started when you initialize the indicators alright i ll wait on pitti for
bug 1439849 in linux ubuntu bug unable to handle kernel null pointer dereference at 0000000000000010 critical confirmed https launchpad net
well the git installation method in the bug report was using update rc d which is the debian approved way
yeah i d be happy to push the changes just less happy about uploading without someone s approval people tend
sarnold should i just make a new comment fixed see attached debdiff and let others take care of all that
the bug log does n t imply a great deal of care factor but i can poke around and see
no hurry should i just unsubscribe sponsors and assign to you i do n t know 1
did you upstream the fix the patch has no header but i think it impacts upstream as well since fedora
howdy still around but running the init script seems to be enough to trigger the bug does n t it
right then no need to do a whole sysv boot really between running the script and a visual confirmation by
yeah should probably be fixed in utopic too fwiw if you want to handle it and push to debian that
heh that s what you get for trying to operate irc on a holiday sarnold or infinity or darkxst would
right ahh sure it would n t catch changes to lsb headers i guess yeah i m in a similar
cyphermox can one of you merge upload https code launchpad net darkxst ubiquity slideshow ubuntu vivid merge 254490 it looks
sarnold darkxst i may not be done with this it needs to be fixed in trusty too however the line
thanks i ve pinged him i do n t know 0
thanks np im off to bed now 0
i ll get back to this on monday it will already be 14 04 2 if you do the regular
ok great thanks a should say 14 04 2 already unless you never upgrade 1
upgrade refuses to add remove packages ive seen crash reports on errors u c of people that have never upgraded
generally yes just pay attention to what it wants to do if it s asking to remove a bunch of
but i take the point about github style deployments that think package managers suck mhm i realized that last bit
i agree it would be nice if systemd would pick up the new sysv init script automatically can you make
thanks gdm is way out of sync but i was trying to go to bed half an hour a go
i do n t know the package much but i think added lts variants makes sense in the context of
today is an holiday in germany good friday darkxst i am installing to ubuntu gnome vivid live cd try ubuntu
darkxst yes i understand but i had several oopses of my own on that silly thing probably ok from a
time to find your own bug to fix so it s unlikely that this would be accepted upstream 0
i m not super picky about the solution mind you but i do think it s rc for both vivid
except for i did n t actually test it yeah maybe it s taking some extra days for a long
yeah i was off yesterday afternoon so doing some sponsoring today in exchange np im off to bed now 1
catching up on the inotify point one of the issue was that you may want to install a set of
ah ok no worry i saw you were discussing about the gdm bug i ll let the ubuntu gnome team
maybe it s off for him though not something that they should do because a lot of other things will
if you want to handle it and push to debian that would be rocking there is a wiki page about
ugh you do n t there is a massive delta on gdm between debian and ubuntu 1
you think the gdm init script is different d 0
i need to finish my gdm3 merge first before that is possible one was already there 0
and while i could make an argument that that s wrong too it s way too late to rebuild literally
yeah they do n t have that bug dunno maybe i was cleaning up test failures 0
gdm is way out of sync but i was trying to go to bed half an hour a go yw
debian supports multiple init system ubuntu always supported one upstart until now and systemd but on some flavors but i
as told we did it in the past but as we merge regularly from debian a lot of packages only
gdm is way out of sync but i was trying to go to bed half an hour a go i
enjoy your long week end after the firstone most bugs will feel more trivial 0
i d still like to know whether anyone is working on the pthread mutex fixup to allow us to fix
3 more days for you to rest o 0
sarnold the bug has not been set to triaged it is still confirmed undecided unassigned does someone need to set
kirkland hey could you review https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source ecryptfs utils bug 1406940 it s in the sponsoring
which only new ones 0
darkxst thanks for all your support good night i hope you have a nice holiday the segfault 1
oh i somewhat did n t notice the upload on vivid changes great thanks so in this case https launchpad
did you upstream the fix the patch has no header but i think it impacts upstream as well since fedora
no rejecting i had applied it in vivid and it broke things weird https retrace fedoraproject org faf reports 352711
lol that s why i suggested upstreaming it the other day 1
it s not really a fix it s a field used in debian to determine who can upload a package
no hurry should i just unsubscribe sponsors and assign to you like pastebin it 0
around sure i can have a look 1
thanks hi 0
enjoy the easter days thanks 0
that was on my list fl things to do today didrocks yah i would figure if they support it it
great thanks it does finish next time 0
yep cloud init gets stopped restarted i d been chalking the swift failure up to the tests do n t
but why it does n t finish initialization next time it runs error malone bug 1432176 not found 0
sure i can have a look i e stop start oops i did n t finish init last time let
but yeah i would n t doubt it s come up before it does finish next time 1
yeah that s the point maybe we need to re init not on reboot but every time with start cloud
the crash yes then it does everything needed when upgrade starts it after upgrade 1
do any of your team have carte blanche within reason to upload sysvinit in debian for the update rc d
your solution could definitely work though launchpad bug 1406940 in ecryptfs utils ubuntu ecryptfs does not work for domain users
by uploading the fix you mean didrock s one or oneshot it does finish next time 0
yeah it should work i think hope we do n t meet oneshot issue later although that might be outdated
ah btw does it mean that cloud init is not upgradable i do n t think you can edit commit
the problem will go away when we have images with cloud init at this next non broken version inside them
i guess the trigger is fine at least conceptually well it could its just the cloud config portion that upgrades
you can use lintian info tags the tag shown to get more info btw is there a bug report for
that s weird do you have it handy hey ok wfm 0
do n t worry the uploaders lines are autoupdated this is for debian no that s fine the utopic is
it s not really a fix it s a field used in debian to determine who can upload a package
after a while if someone did n t upload that package he she will be stripped out of the uploaders
sarnold thanks more information on https www debian org doc debian policy ch controlfields html s f uploaders 1
i ve updated that bug with 2 comments one describing what we decided to do and why and the other
and usually with good reason looking good thanks for summarizing 1
no idea i was n t looking at it yes hmm 0
as we start restart units there ok great thanks 1
probably you re running it from a root owned directory if you run it in a directory you already own
sarnold no sorry for being naggy about that but vivid release is soon and that issue is quite annoying for
launchpad bug 1406940 in ecryptfs utils ubuntu ecryptfs does not work for domain users ad likewise powerbroker undecided new no
i understand sbuild schroot internals are outside of my comfort zone does n t that sound like the perfect day
i will look asap maybe tomorrow and i am watching that page but it has a lot of entries so
sarnold you want to look over my patch comment https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source gdm bug 1315442 i guess
at this point i d prefer a least invasive change running daemon reload in update rc d would fit that
yes i confirm there s not i guess it s a bug in the sddm packaging hm yeah so why
i ll do some extra bookkeeping so i can kill that task if when that happens but it d be
does sddm have a log that i can use for debugging sarnold thanks for looking at it i figure the
you want apt get dist upgrade as it seems to ignore my settings in etc sddm conf 1
var log sddm log darkxst i am going to look for a fix that has some c code in it
thanks to you seb128 oh i see the problem now thanks 1
yeah it probably does n t actually matter it just seemed out of place you think the gdm init script
pull lp source should dtrt though heh sure but do n t you get emails for build failures too 0
but that s a small and unfortunate corner case that does n t matter much at runtime anyway only at
does n t that sound like the perfect day to end the week if there s no source line then
it s difficult to find the correct source package for a given binary package the apt cache show grep source
mhm i realized that last bit now i have gnome staging ppa and that seems to be the cause probably
do we really care about git installation using systemd when someone does n t know how to use it properly
thanks sweet 1
hiya the bitbucket stuff yeah i need to create a bitbucket account so i can test it myself i need
it s on my list have n t gotten to it yet for reference i ll tell you here if
um i do n t know ah sorry about that in case you did n t have it https bitbucket
very good i ll get it because due to outdated packages it was impossible to generate a useful stack trace
sarnold oh i know pull lp source lshw right and poked them about being able to retrive keys not owned
bug 1315442 in gdm ubuntu trusty extra fi in etc init d gdm undecided confirmed https launchpad net bugs 1315442
it s a friggin public key kubuntu 15 04 daily 0
you deleted the vivid patch from the bug didrocks why do we have the sysv stuff at all if we
i m entirely on board with the behaviour being suboptimal p so we could n t sync automatically 0
the bug log does n t imply a great deal of care factor but i can poke around and see
fair enough i would n t object to the skip the assert if ppid 0 bandaid i do n t
sarnold omg i see now there are several deb files created from sbuild i guess i need to install all
just write it straight into the bug you can always change it later if really needed np im off to
indeed the solution sounds sane enough to me ok 1
just write it straight into the bug you can always change it later if really needed did you sponsor that
that recently changed you had some patch cruft in debian p2 which was obviously an oops 1
yes hmm yeah sounds about right and please keep me posted 0
and how is that a kubuntu problem you choose what sites you open not the operating system you may have
hmm p 0
yeah i looked that up here you go https launchpad net blueleaflinux archive ppa 1
how are you trying to do it im not sure as i ve never tried but it sounds like something
i guess you have to ask a question first then after install it showed the name in a dialogue but
how are you trying to do it im not sure as i ve never tried but it sounds like something
morning adn34 have you tried view adjust view properties 1
you have separate partitions for windows and ubutnu right perfect found it thank you 1
hmm i ca n t see the option what version of kde i think this is recommended 0
i try to change my user name on my computer but after i type my password it says acsses denied
yeah i get the same error message run this commands in a terminal 0
something is n t ported yet to new frameworka that makes this problem it wo n t work atm 1
either on assignment or on caps depending on the usage something something inquisitive idiots 1
done hehe 1
do you know that mvo helped me out in my first days of ubuntu 0
https play golang org p yzm8etl5gs i d be more surprised if he had n t because yes 1
it is the former cmds py cmd in some sense landed 1
oh sorry i was slow i would be happy with todos 0
i went to remove some code from https github com ubuntu core snappy pull 205 0
do we have a bu for the ubuntu core is 1b big i think that fixes all of the comments
so in this case https github com zyga snappy blob caps api assign daemon api go l1016 it just adds
because you re racing to have a vertical working it s fine to use reflect deepequal to save time it
but the right way would be to implement an equals or whatever yourself it s a bit convoluted at first
ok on assignment struct 1
hmm okay something else is going on here then i ll keep digging will that make comparison on two slices
not that this code is staying but i m curious how to do it in go in general cs req
i mean i only used deep equals because afair go s does n t compare slices step is good i
amazing thanks e g newcap assignments equals oldcap assignments 1
fwiw in the general case deepequals will not do what you want 1
it only works there because you re only letting assignments have 0 or 1 elements yeah the echo doesnt show
should i move the modules from c9 to oh 1
duuuude but given that it s more like a set order should n t be important 1
can you explain why it would not work webdm edge failed to install a package by that name is already
unless i m misunderstanding not yet they will be confusing they ll be there when i add strip 0
very good thanks ah i see 1
yes i really miss basic collections here um that looks right 0
yep you are correect oh 0
this is a set assignment in python s 3 5 parlance fix uploaded 0
even more reason to punt that work to after the demo whats on 80 0
lxd really failed is an assignment ever going to be more than a snap name and a slot name 1
i do n t believe so chipaca it would really help me if you could re check and land https
it s sufficient for anything i was imagining much further down the linre i think the timeout is to sowrt
poor guy then if a b a and b ca n t both be in assignments 1
it is a set not a multi set thanks 0
ok please remove install again set tuple str sr in python s typing 1
you wanted to start a fight now go you are exactly right 1
https play golang org p yzm8etl5gs looking forward to that 0
right actually ignore that for a bit 1
https play golang org p spreading 0
should i move the modules from c9 to looking 1
we have used it successfully since 15 04 i think why a map 1
and can a map use assignment keys i assume go somehow makes that struct comparable beause it has trivial fields
because a set is a map without values on assignment struct 0
ah right that makes sesnse it indeed smells like there s no uevent when the device gets added 0
thanks yes it s quite powerful can express various things once the pieces are in place 0
iface eth0 inet dhcp i m looking at https github com ubuntu core snappy pull 208 1
it seems the gustavo wants err on the deaemon response or was it resp type yep 0
https golang org ref spec you wanted to start a fight now go 0
not sure though i mean if assignment a assignment b only if a s snap and slot b s snap
best to ask gustavo what gustavo wants yes bits landed in the meantime 0
attendee join for attendee in elopio kyrofa right i remember reading that a few weeks ago i was just double
but the right way would be to implement an equals or whatever yourself meaning that as long as the structs
how would you feel if i added daemon resp err method ok please remove install again 0
okk 80 should be open soon puzzled 1
meaning dunno if it s worth documenting it until the whole thing is stable that conjures an error if the
you meanie puzzled because client does n t use daemon and should n t 1
but gustavo pointed out a test case for api go sure thing elopio 0
so this is pure server side stuff obtained ioutil nopcloser ioutil nopcloser reader bytes reader 0xc820013650 0
well i can go ahead and just do it i ve added a todo to document all the new rest
but it feels somewhat weird since it s just for testing there you go d 0
and this structure never becomes an error otherwise as far as i can see odd i can publish to that
well i paid for the mp3 spreding it isnt legal i think there was a different comment from gustavo about
it was about client side stuff and it s done now christams is coming soon 0
it was about processerrorresponse landed 0
there are similar comments involving err in several branches afair so this is pure server side stuff 0
lol i ll work on assign changes we ve discussed 1
even if it does n t land before end of week i d like to have something that works to
req body there ya go 1
well no ip i think that one s ready to land with this yes 1
lxd really failed https github com ubuntu core snappy pull 208 i d like to improve the test for client
update did nothing i m just reading how to mock that with setdoer 1
so you want an integration ish test why does snappy list on the rpi show generic i386 and generic amd64
k i uninstalled http chipaca 1
you ca n t trust that chipaca person lol 0
please run sudo snappy install webdm edge and see if that installs version 0 11 so ass1 ass2 should be
hm sudo snappy update webdm edge maybe if not you need to uninstall first and then reinstall webdm edge it
ok please remove install again done 0
yay oh sergiusens elopio i have another meeting clashing with standup today any chance we can push it back an
the launcher i think yes 1
in which case grab cs req and check it it just adds a lot of moise to the boot 0
ah about already mounted wahwahwah d 1
um that looks right it s a bit convoluted at first when you re not familiar 1
oh i ll be avail on the 21st personally i would unabbreviate some of the variables 1
mosquitto seems to not register binaries i think it s because it s not my first language 1
ah right that makes sesnse me wonders how to get the request body out of the mock doer code 1
req body kyrofa hmm i ll see how i can make it then 0
i mean i removed that that is just a new namespace being setup 0
so in this case https github com zyga snappy blob caps api assign daemon api go l1016 no not dumb
but if it s already mounted it shoudl be fine i guess um that looks right 1
yep yep but i still happy about it already doing things that were umpossible before it does n t work
thanks kyrofa i have one too https github com ubuntu core snapcraft pull 137 0
well i got run networking trace now but i cant make it come up without ip anymore will this allow
this is not running in my lan yeah 0
oh nice i can tweak that should there 0
what if we suggested that prs be squashed it s also possible that one of the two is using the
haha no problem webdm is linked against a version of snappy that might not be the system snappy 1
this is one of the things the rest api is trying to fix simplified https github com ubuntu core snappy
no merge removed the carpet from under this branch s feet simplified https github com ubuntu core snappy commit db9343ccda229cc40a0c676a3b10469bab2a2541
o so i might have to split this one test per task but it s going to be hard to
just fixing tests to mean stuff except for the bit about all tests failing 1
well if you have time want to see if that execute function makes sense to you https github com sergiusens
no merge removed the carpet from under this branch s feet i think getattr is more expensive than if elif
yea me too very much it s intended you use there api to bulk create tasks but i ve not
ok i managed a boot with ip https github com zyga snappy commit 10fcafb771c5002bc9831714de0b6573fc4c45f1 and https github com zyga snappy
yeah man hit me i updated webdm in the stable channel now to 0 11 too 0
hmm snapcraft heading there now 1
another thing i do n t like about irc writing like a fool without knowing i was offline p i
looking at it now i m trying to use self run to run sed and having all kinds of issues
thats missing in the initrd mount script in rolling http paste ubuntu com 13648333 kyrofa i have one too https
this is the one you deleted before maybe it s still there because you hate it and want it to
i ll take a crack at it tell me if you can do anything with it 0
done alright i ll get on that as soon as i finish up this roslaunch thing 1
touch a file in tmp and you will see elopio ok feel free to entertain yourself with this one https
hello any advice on how to do that 0
costa rica ah 0
thats legal isnt it i still have my hat 1
i can try to put it back a quality assurance developer 1
i have mine too but i ca n t wear it when i have long hair it does n t
very good thanks ha i do n t have that issue d 1
that is just a new namespace being setup yeah for 1 x it needs to stay as 15 04 requires
i m just reading how to mock that with setdoer kyrofa hmm i ll see how i can make it
well dav 104 196 33 52 works at least if that s difficult would pushing it back a half an
nah an hour is easier it just needs to last 15 minutes tops i still have my hat 0
are you going to be on vacation at 21st dec already yup 0
oh i ll be avail on the 21st haha no problem 0
forgot to mention i ll be off all other days though do we break old packages 0
now it workd ok cool let me do some timezone math 1
sure i can wiggle time around and about err no 0
just try to not make it 3am my time but i m fine with 6am or 10pm it was about
yay i m playing with hard stuff now cloud9 that s nodejs it ends up with the modules in apps
i mean i removed that i was mostly wondering if any name needs quoting but if its only a za
yea me too very much it s intended you use there api to bulk create tasks but i ve not
e g newcap assignments equals oldcap assignments so i might have to split this one test per task but it
obtained ioutil nopcloser ioutil nopcloser reader bytes reader 0xc820013650 you could split it into two do the first task that
the tasks are intended to be 3 5 hours each thank you very much for adding the tasks i appreciate
haha no problem ack 1
we can meet tomorrow then i ve been fixing some of the issues in the scalingstack instances hopefully we ll
but apparently it adds extra filtering i saw your rts thanks 1
no should n t have we also did n t get a newer ifupdown on require it says that the
but nb that we never supported allow hotplug in ubuntu it indeed smells like there s no uevent when the
i probably changed the race we couldnt use auto because then the system would wait for network when the nic
and it works some of the time right with plain devices it ought to work 1
if having issues chipaca always has the magic one liners our ifenslave bridge utils etc packages do n t work
that s fne so the last change to ifup service happened before october so i doubt that s it is
well no ip o 0
there are similar comments involving err in several branches afair do you have a journal output 1
could we see the journalctl of one time it does work it originally lived here lp snappy dev snappy hub
so in this case https github com zyga snappy blob caps api assign daemon api go l1016 yeah i ca
raspberrypi2 ubuntu localhost cat etc network interfaces d eth0 it s actually more likely that there s some race condition
more seriously could you just add an echo before after the ifup call that sohudl appear in the journal but
rsp req resp all look too similar it s possible the old file leftover underneath was hiding this issue 1
germany 1
yeah ip again it seems we are n t yet doing it like that in rolling but we should because
it just adds a lot of moise to the boot why a map 0
yeah for instance dholbach s pr would probably be useful to both branches no 0
i didnt say slow down just that noise is chatty ah right that makes sesnse 0
you wanted to start a fight now go oh nice i can tweak that 0
i was mostly wondering if any name needs quoting but if its only a za z0 9 this is a
the stage argument feels overloaded do we have a better name for that step maybe good morning 0
step is good i think it is how we document it thank you very much for adding the tasks i
it indeed smells like there s no uevent when the device gets added is this good enough paste ubuntu com
yes thanks except for the bit about all tests failing 0
update did nothing not yet they will be confusing they ll be there when i add strip 1
how can i help there there s a todo for the docstring too 1
kyrofa https github com ubuntu core snapcraft pull 148 ah i see 0
thanks i have no idea how the code coverage dropped well i do i removed test code that probably made
hi perhaps you can help me i would like to create a snap package the dummiest but valid possible snap
thank you do we have a bu for the ubuntu core is 1b big 0
pedronis even dummier than that https github com ubuntu core snappy tree master integration tests data snaps there is a
and you can strip them even more removing the binaries from basic binaries then it would be nothing useful just
touch a file in tmp and you will see amazing thanks 1

germany yup okay good moving on 1
i m trying to use self run to run sed and having all kinds of issues poor guy 0
use subprocess that is a good idea i saw it would be picked up by github want to craft one
hi i uploaded a fix for the tmp issue from yesterday buildig a new image now ah interesting okay 1
may i recommend a python regex with one song 0
i was thinking about that too yes 0
if having issues chipaca always has the magic one liners nice game 0
yea me too very much it s intended you use there api to bulk create tasks but i ve not

c check cs req body check equals foo oh eventually some regexes with python to not call sed 1
let me try the echos makes sense 1
thanks although i suspect this ll make the automagic sideload version thing not pop up which ll be a problem

i d appreciate a quick review so that it does n t get stale if poss there are no manual
not very explicit of what is that for so all these should be testable but i might ve missed something
my change is targetted against v3 unstable is n t it does n t yum support some sort of pinning
we can it is a matter of prioritizing it amount the 800 other bugs and the only place one is
and my understanding of what the team had agreed upon for going forward mocks stubs embedded along side code happy
you dont want to en up with an unsupported cloud tools and that guy has the noble goal of sorting
reading state information done my take just add a mock implementtion of pining for the moment 1
true but this gets us to a bigger problem that s a cloud tools repo full of deb s which
i dont think that old app to install debs in redhat still exist right is someone looking at https bugs
that s a good question either way it would n t be too much work just the juju mongodb package
carnival p will look further into the matter and will take your advice for now and just work around this
seems the easiest way for the moment but that s ok i got the info i needed ill let you
much obliged d without knowing where and why i cant tell you for sure 0
is someone looking at https bugs launchpad net juju core bug 1421606 i just saw its blocking trunk right 0
but short answer is no no one was looking at that i guess we will have to since that seems

well we re hopefully going to be doing regular weekly chats about features we re working on though today s
i mock readfile and i can check the pre canned data is used so i can test the file is
right the zone placement should be outsize the constraints nothing major mostly just moving the stuff we discussed in the
for reference somehow main got unchecked from my list of package sources nice 1
sudo password for nate 0
you can type juju help ec2 provider for specific help with ec2 but the placement directive should just be zone
13 56 also looking at our instance types you are right we only know about t1 micro atm 1
sure i can add that back in zone availability zone name 1
by the way pretty sure we ll get the keys to the new house on wednesday but then it says
so i definitely need to watch both right the zone placement should be outsize the constraints 1
reading state information done juju bootstrap zone name constraints 1
you got there first was just typing that my fault i ve never actually used zone with bootstrap only with
not solved the problem though still getting ok 0
try running a destroy environment you may have to use force to clean up then retry bootstrap o 0
did a few times already after every failed attempt thx you ve been faster 0
you can check juju environments probably an old amazon jenv hanging around so this is the deal i am working
it s very insightful and has given me plenty to think about nah deleted juju and ran juju init 1
hrmph then i do n t know you may have found a bug unless someone else here has some ideas
bug 1421606 testaddservicestorageconstraints fails on ppc64 ci regression test failure juju core triaged https launchpad net bugs 1421606 trying with
i d appreciate a quick review so that it does n t get stale if poss there are no manual
i mock readfile and i can check the pre canned data is used so i can test the file is
pong o 1
arg yes this arithmetic behavior oh i c 0
there s a similar argument for not allowing negative slice indexes like in python thanks 0
you mean in network port error failed to bootstrap environment subprocess encountered error code 1 0
ok ty for the review yep 1
yeah that sounds like a good idea i d suggest adding this to your list of things to change in
not very explicit of what is that for number is an int and so could have invalid values 1
and my understanding of what the team had agreed upon for going forward mocks stubs embedded along side code happy
you wanted some pictures of the snow here you go http imgur com a yqfqs they are validated internally but
yep i d even go further and suggest having a type porttype uint16 in the network package and use it
i thought this might come up the new v4 signing messes with request headers so there s no concept of
sure i can add that back in yeah and you can even have methods on it 1
s states status yeah that s cool 1
currently standup but will look then but once your change lands their code wo n t compile anymore with v2
ta my question is how necessary is it we set up apt package pinning i see it s only actually
http reviews vapour ws r 932 i actually interrupted my lunch to troll you and you counter troll me 0
already opened will review after standup pong 0
thanks you got there first was just typing that my fault i ve never actually used zone with bootstrap only
get a link to something in your bucket that s accessible to public permission wise 1 1
hope i can help what s up thanks 1
aw remind me of the juju magic word for submitting a pr please bug 1421606 testaddservicestorageconstraints fails on ppc64 ci
hey sorry what are you meaning when you say d likewise 0
i m currently working on getting centos fully supported cloudinit and sshinit capable my first point of concern being abstracting
so are you referring to whitespace in a lot of those error failed to bootstrap environment subprocess encountered error code
which you would know if you used vi p ok 0
will have a look but d it s nicer and geeky d 1
niemeyer convinced me fake was n t the right name should n t it be dd 1
http www reddit com r golang comments 2vo357 i tend to use whitespace to aid in readability 1
i actually interrupted my lunch to troll you and you counter troll me with your last addings to mega multi
typo during review thankfully not published w o correction i muahaha at you sir 1
yep i understand 1
i m not done yet so the status for the unit is already updated by watching a separate collection right
np oh i know but i wanted to say ty 1
eh i ll still argue both have their place np 1
you have a review aww 0
o tyvm 1
hey rq about the signedurl oh and al of this before coffee 0
i thought this might come up the new v4 signing messes with request headers so there s no concept of
i understand i d like to read about this more if you have the source 1
check out aws sign go yeah it s been lingering around for a bit 0
also is the v4 signing process now mandatory for all s3 operations how does this sound 0
https github com go amz amz blob v1 aws sign go l82 p 0
it is not you pass in which signing you d like into s3 ctor here too and also tuesday 0
i feel like we re rehashing this i sent out an email a bit ago about the new top level
george washington s birthday first president of the us guessing that s not what you re celebrating for v2 signedurl
for url it did n t make much sense to me what would you do with it yes 0
lxc conf does include some details from pcii network name and mac get a link to something in your bucket
and thus past their eow i believe ah ok 1
lots of people or very important 1
trying with region set to us east 1 in the yaml config if that fails i ll create a bug
trying with region set to us east 1 in the yaml config if that fails i ll create a bug
jog thanks i spaced on the url that was the idea 1
is versioning of goamz tied to something why ca n t we do a cut how does this sound 0
and progress marches inexorably forward out of respect for any potential users 1
they re free to remain on v2 are n t they ty 0
yes 0
but once your change lands their code wo n t compile anymore with v2 0
g night all my change is targetted against v3 unstable is n t it 1
aww lol no 0
and even if we did n t and url signedurl no longer make sense we ca n t just drop
nothing major mostly just moving the stuff we discussed in the overview into the core of the doc oh no
see testnetworking in this branch and i actually asked you to re target it 1
ok then it s fine so i definitely need to watch both 0
heya perrito666 still is n t url worth keeping 1
sure i can add that back in while the start instance tests can just check the commands get called or
thanks yay for utopic 0
yeah that sounds like a good idea i d suggest adding this to your list of things to change in
i can do both it will be a function that is region resolves3bucketendpoint b name path 1
i still need to do that lol 0
however just a sec while the start instance tests can just check the commands get called or fail 0
done i hate it how gh sends comments before you have a chance to correct them as you pointed out
so i definitely need to watch both if this needs to go in juju for 1 23 then you ll
jog thanks i spaced on the url any reason we ca n t move juju to v3 1
we could but this ll mean carefully integrating changes from v2 renaming v3 unstable to v3 and branching v4 unstable
you use intellij right as we ca n t depend on v3 unstable for a release in juju 1
the failures need testing as well like if pcii fails or one of the other steps fail right 1
i ll look at adding that i m good with whatever you suggest 1
there are not many things to port from v2 to v3 iirc bug 802117 juju ssh scp commands cause spurious
then let s agree to do this migration i have a couple of prs for goamz which i ll need
yeah it s been lingering around for a bit ok cool 1
cheers you wanted some pictures of the snow here you go http imgur com a yqfqs 0
are all the clouds updated i did n t quite get your response on whether you ve run go test
lxc conf does include some details from pcii network name and mac and progress marches inexorably forward 1
no i have n t done that yet but it does n t go over the api 0
as it should urg 0
ok just a reminder then and even if we did n t and url signedurl no longer make sense we
yes it does but for settling priorities for whole repositories not for a single package available in multiple sources yep
that s a good question either way it would n t be too much work just the juju mongodb package
o that s fine ideally we d like a live test using both s3test and live aws but at minimum
will do thanks for the pointers and your help you got there first was just typing that my fault i
jog that is logical i was not aware no worries thank s for bearing up with me 1
it was not a burden great questions you wanted some pictures of the snow here you go http imgur com
i could just mock out the call that takes the networkinfo and check that the results of preparecontainerinterfaceinfo are used
my question is how necessary is it we set up apt package pinning i see it s only actually done
hmm let me think morning 0
and as far as i can tell the results of calling broker startinstance do n t include network details to
do you have a wip branch up to have a look fwiw that s the nomenclature i ve always seen
and if i watch unit it never gets informed of the other changes yep hang on 1
all these are just the happy path tests i ll push what i have 1
what is it there cheers 1
fowler cites http xunitpatterns com mocks 20fakes 20stubs 20and 20dummies html so the result of startinstance after pcii did its
shall i check that first yeah i do n t mind it that much though 0
pong yes please 1
looking i ll check the conf file and see if it has testable info 1
i can do both because this is later needed in other cases 1
delete so the result of pcii is used to generate lxc conf cloud init userdata and to run a few
so all these should be testable but i might ve missed something shit i should n t have asked 0
see testnetworking in this branch hi all a question trying to bootstrap my ec2 environment in eu west 1 but
https github com voidspace juju compare container prepareprovisioner 1 0
looking ta 0
the output of lxc networkinfo is network interfaceinfo nil that was the idea 0
glad it s being useful that is an excellent question we need better tags for now send me a note
done i hate it how gh sends comments before you have a chance to correct them so i ll be
1 sure you mean the killfile anastasiamac rule 0
error invalid value arch amd64 cpu cores 1 cpu power 100 mem 1740m root disk 8192m availability zone eu west
currently standup but will look then so coming back to your question 1
these are a few ideas of what needs testing there and i actually asked you to re target it 0
just got back to the keyboard sounds like alexisb has you covered 1 given a networkinfo and provided networking and
so that will mean adding the networkinfo themue a large but totally trivial change https github com juju juju pull
yeah it totally has someone just hit it on the mailing list i ve always just removed offending keys but
i can step through code in emacs as well testing 2 3 will effectively mean duplicating the commands straight from
but i think its past their eod so they re not very good tests 1
thanks well not quite 1
oops dimitern mock and record the calls check the calls match the expected calls 1
the command tests can separately test the behavior around parsing resolv conf and setting up iptables etc my take just
oh no biggie we can code a shim to translate between our nomenclatures what do you mean by command tests
cheers while the start instance tests can just check the commands get called or fail 1
ok let s have a chat on monday 1
just to clarify though except natefinch 0
so that will mean adding the networkinfo i need to sit down and write this first 1
you need the networkinfo populated on startinstanceresult hope i can help what s up 0
i m really struggling to test the lxc broker changes i m thinking of several levels of tests 1
bug 1421606 testaddservicestorageconstraints fails on ppc64 ci regression test failure juju core triaged https launchpad net bugs 1421606 yes indeed
if this needs to go in juju for 1 23 then you ll need to cherry pick what s relevant
so i ll leave it up to you likewise 1
or you can find the charm you are interested in on the top level page and just click on it
lol i ca n t expect every user to do that though 1
i expect ever cloud user and lxc user has come across this given time and has realised they do n
we do still use this in juju iirc yeah it totally has someone just hit it on the mailing list
we can it is a matter of prioritizing it amount the 800 other bugs and no i am not 0
just got back to the keyboard sounds like alexisb has you covered yep 0
mine too ack 0
that is an excellent question we need better tags for now send me a note with the bug number and
see http martinfowler com articles mocksarentstubs html thedifferencebetweenmocksandstubs ack 1
mine too what is it there 1
eh i ll still argue both have their place pong 1
if they use url and or signedurl http reports vapour ws charm summary is the top level for charms and
ok or you can find the charm you are interested in on the top level page and just click on
o could you take a quick look at https github com juju testing pull 51 1
niemeyer convinced me fake was n t the right name cool hopefully it wo n t conflict 0
fwiw that s the nomenclature i ve always seen as well mocks stubs aw remind me of the juju magic
he sets them up on notifies from irc katco i generally use stub as a verb to stub out an
yep that s a good question either way it would n t be too much work just the juju mongodb
so all that patch does it change the name ouch 0
i was the same but wallyworld pointed out to me awhile ago that stub had an actual meaning bug 1417875
as far as agreeing on nomenclature that s rather important i e it s how humans communicate well my plan
ty yeah that s exactly what i read a few months ago 1
and that guy has the noble goal of sorting out the nomenclature that was the idea 0
i feel like we re rehashing this i sent out an email a bit ago about the new top level
eh i ll still argue both have their place nothing major mostly just moving the stuff we discussed in the
and my understanding of what the team had agreed upon for going forward mocks stubs embedded along side code happy

ah the magic seems to be adding the developer mode argument for locally built packages aah sure just a sec
i ll try that http pastebin com sszsfzgt 1
no i just followed the conversation before you joined i guess has one though so that fine that creates the
but nothing okay but i start that as a service 1
you what but i can execute the script when not using systemd 0
it is supposed to be started by systemd would you mind trying with the released image 0
i ca n t find it either by just grepping so it must be an indirect call i think but
it is supposed to be started by systemd hehe so basically i just run sudo systemctl start rda 1 and
so could you pastebin the service file from etc systemd system btw usbhostmanager getusbservices is from javax usb and i
but it will be lost on upgrade should be something like rda service 1
err sure http pastebin com jn2gq3sk 1
ok okay so this will be a problem for me then for example i need wi fi and that does
is that the right way okay the openjdk does n t make it better 0
that works but tbh i d rather set this up in ubuntu app launcher 136 29 kb 136 29 kb
i e just mount a private tmp into the app s namespace so that you do n t need a
i m making you look in the wrong place that sounds a lot better a lot of code does n
if you re running on an arm board and you know that extracion is happening every time your app starts
hello i m new to snappy and just learning my way around i noticed that with the ros snap i
not on my watch poking around a little it seems we need to drop a file in one of the
np no you do n t need to just the launcher 1
your thing is a framework on ubuntu core launcher yes 1
sgtm asac also wanted private dev but that s hairier which box do you mean i ca n t find
alright thank you i m pretty convinced that nothing is using that syscall and there are other low level issues
ok i thought we d had to go back on that for now but glad to be wrong installing ubuntu
hm got another problem now i put java into an own framework package and it works completely now i have
an interpreter isnt a resource can you provide an update to just filesystem doc and at best integrate that as
i felt that was coming sorry 0
is there a way to make sure that s what i did for now 1
it s actually not my code it happens in the usb4java library which basically is based on a c library
perhaps there is a way to disable it at compilation it was introduced in 2 6 39 kernel 4 years
i did n t compile it myself yet so i guess i should do that now the library i use
hi and thanks just shoot 0
hey you what 0
sorry you might wait for tyhicks response 1
hi i ve cloned the libusb4java and usb4java git trees and i m not finding where that syscall is being
if your java thing expects pwd to be writeable better cd to or before starting it i ca n t
the function is called once i call usbhostmanager getusbservices or xeogijuoifvhiofiodsfqrigikvnueoicodifighiu43 0
what was your upgrade series to get into that state i m also very confused everything else in my java
or xeogijuoifvhiofiodsfqrigikvnueoicodifighiu43 fyi https codesearch debian net results 1
i m on page 8 on bbb 0
i think that might be what is reported in the bug on upgrade problems i did n t see any
no i mean the wrapper that s created for the binaries declared in your package yaml and placed in apps
i wish i could track that system call down a bit more like with a call stack or something they
r30 to r33 was ok i pulled down the tip of the jdk8u tree http hg openjdk java net jdk8u
i m pretty convinced that nothing is using that syscall and there are other low level issues at play around
it s not even on the trello yet is there a way to make sure 1
i can try to find the source of the kernel that you re running that s the bug that i
libseccomp did not implement them all jdstrand send a patch upstream maybe there are more private arm syscalls but really
that happens when trying cd you can try that but do n t spend too much time on it 1
i do n t think it ll help since i think the problem is lower in the stack than openjdk
done fyi http paste ubuntu com 10879065 1
yes it s certainly the same bug what was your upgrade path on this system ok 0
or xeogijuoifvhiofiodsfqrigikvnueoicodifighiu43 r33 trying to go to r36 1
the private syscalls have a much higher number 370 is in the normal range and not a private arm syscall
note i ve tried several times to upgrade is that the right way 0
docker blocks it by default of course they have a way to add it actually i think i started on
android keyboard wow guess you try snappy on your laptop right now not sure if you say my other comments
right we must not send an update to the stable channel until we have figured that too but webdm we
yeah i got hit installing it and could n t figure out why i could n t access it good
however i still think something odd is going on and do n t feel comfortable white listing that syscall until
sorry was in a meeting okay so this will be a problem for me then for example i need wi
hm the code to make it is there i just asked 2 minutes ago 1
flash r30 upgrading to r33 tried to get to r36 he is not using openjdk but oracles java for rpi
so we use our official infra to do that which is not very nicely documented good morning 0

can you post an image of the problem wow now nvidia settings shows everything 1
http pastebin com v5k1wjk3 then audio setup 0
the real test is your monitor resolution settings and desktop effects no it s for anyone you just need to
easy seems like everything works ok thanks for help 1
maybe he is drunk or who knows but please be lenient ok glad to hear you have it working 1
adblock can affect captchas iirc can you post an image of the problem 0

kubuntu 14 10 seems to have a problem with the save dialog in libreoffice it is non standard and very
anyone helping me without reading what the problem is 1
i suppose i was just giving an example of a state of mind hi rharish 0

which i ve half done now was too lazy to do the other half before trying a quick build thanks
so i need some help deleting binaries for libual and anything that depends on it for those architectures that looks
the first one is worth a dig but also perfectly reasonable for us to give a temp pass and stop
heh yes i was just about to try a ppc build to see what the issue is it s been
i m just wanting to know if this is standard practice anyhow i m on vac until tomorrow if it
i think the issue is something with mesa and the test suite i ve suggested the test suite passing is
enjoy your napping beer my plan was to cargo cult exactly the same hacks that are in place for arm64
and then we can probably just temp ignore the ppc specific failures asked 1

thank you its installed in muon package manager 0
was more thinking in the lines of compiling yw 1
of course kubuntu org see ya 0
did you see this comment in your link it does work i have it running here you will also have

where is the best place to get kubuntu 14 04 themes looking for something darker than the default but it
that said it does n t seem to be in the repos just in a ppa i installed ambient noise
its not crucial app for me yes 1
ugly etc probably just to initialize it however it does n t matter 1
cristianita format what exactly 1
jez run its channel of zombies not to worry that s standard procedure in kubuntu ubiquity installer it will be

that is per default do n t worry about it how to reconfigure all apps i guess there are alot
that is true k thanks 0
kde look org update upgrade and dist upgrade first 1
this is a test which kubuntu 1
there are ways kubuntu 14 10 is solid stable and fast and easier to use than unity or gnome ime

package anoise does not exist in utopic isnt there a dpgk i reconfigure all kind of thing 1
rvr thanks not yet and i have a plan i have a ps3 gun and i m not affraid to
i was at the meeting yes found a confused device and have taken it offline reruns have started 0
too much overloading shhhh or they might 1
hmm certainly give me the url as usual 1
but not hidden on the requests view it s still running do n t it https ci train ubuntu com
not according to https launchpad net ci train ppa service archive ubuntu landing 032 packages is there something wrong with
we ca n t just sync that package from wily right i only see my photos facebook request to log
i do n t think there s a problem with recompiling the wily version if you mean that it d
are the gates for wily opened again maybe 0
i d be cautious to say they are since the gcc5 transition to release pocket is still not complete but
certainly silos can be built etc we might need to do some double checking before publishing ohh sorry 0
certainly whenever it s feasible to build from the same sources for both releases it s better not to maintain
generally i would recommend the dual silo but i guess gcc5 threw a wrench in those gears ok then let
that ll make a silo harder yeah did a first attempt which was meant to be an update of the
you should already have according to https launchpad net ci train users members anyway this does n t really matter
ah strange was getting an error page before seems to be working now trainguards hey so on the new bileto
depends great 1
saw this and thought of you http imgur com gallery xmdyngo i guess my list of stuff will keep on
okay so it seems abandoned landed only appear when you search nice the first part never happens to my cats
i ll check that as well this silo broke builds of unity8 in vivid 1
so did it get reverted 1
i do n t think anything got reverted changes from this silo at least for unity api were landed manually
ok i see trainguards should n t those branches have been merged back if we landed them into vivid o
seems correct they are in vivid overlay i can try to manually run the clean job to merge those after
trainguards hey so on the new bileto how do i say i tested something on wily and it s good
that s a mirv thing afaik also i d like to understand why it was pushed manually looks like asking
a dual landing is a wily landing that just happens to duplicate the silo contents s 15 10 15 04
ok that worked so the trunks are now up to date althought missing the gcc5 rebuild changelog entries ok can
right no you need to click assign it reconfigures if it s already assigned 0
okay hm well i know very little about c unfortunately 0
tsdgeos if one of you would just approve autopkgtest for qtcreator plugin ubuntu 3 1 1 15 10 20150720 0ubuntu1
nice i will just have to rebuild it for the gcc5 transition although i ve fallen in love with dual
yeah do n t let the train rot your brain too much but no code changes 1
approving silo 15 thx 1
thanks dude weird it seems fine to me now 1
the client side javascript pulls all the data so any network problem could cause it check with doko i do
oh ah i already tried to abandon the silo and requested another one so we need to rebuild unity8 unity
ohh sorry i suspect just location service needs a rebuild 0
i guess my list of stuff will keep on growing as i land more np just a sec 1
kenvandine i guess my real question is how long do we allow ourselves to be blocked with dual landings rather
hah ok then i ll just free up the silo and find later on if that should have happened automatically
ill email it over i m just back so not exactly super familiar with the new system but cleaning the
thanks balloons psivaa okay cool whatever the reason i m sure it can be figured out 1
you edit it and put the status to publish without qa ok 0
what happens when you click abandon it s supposed to just hide the request it s not supposed to free
that s pretty much what it did too much overloading 0
dash view what a mess 0
ah ok whats up 1
got a instagram click update ready to go to the store it just fixes not being able to add an
nope looks like everything s correct got a sec to test so i can push to the store 1
mirv maybe nope 1
i am told only for libraries should be suuper quick to test its a one line change in the provider
okay so it seems abandoned landed only appear when you search anyway this does n t really matter right now
yep i ll implement pagination soon so the list does n t just grow to infinity in staging i ve
thats my ponytail i guess i m saying i do n t really want to see them at all 1
whats up not sure how to handle that since the search is specifically for finding landings that have been hidden
well that s why my first suggestion was a new page for my landings yeah it s fine 0
ok can you for a bug against lp bileto sounds like a good idea ohh look it indeed it did
timo was too and was the only one there who knew sil was sick will do 1
i logged into instagram thanks 1
but things will certainly get nasty because of binary incompat issues between things on gcc5 and gcc 4 9 https
i ll check that as well yes landings are open as gcc 5 is in proposed and we build agianst
if you get new branches it s trivial to reconfigure the silo oh maybe it had been failing earlier before
meh so wily landings are busted until all these dependency issues in the migration get fixed ugh i just realized
including unity8 i m curious why you d say that the disc is full in core apps jenkins 0
i do n t think there s a problem with recompiling the wily version if you mean that it d
this is probably related to the gcc update that was started friday ok great 0
ok there s a transition from libtrust store1 to libtrust store2 1
anyway this does n t really matter right now as i have the effect i wanted which is my old
but based on what s being removed that s what i suspect you edit it and put the status to
certainly give me the url as usual ack 1
hm i seem to have lost my irc connection is it okay for me to push instagram to the store
what about them they re handled manually so as long as you prepare the sources by hand then you can
depends sil is sick jibel is on vacation and davmor2 probably drowns in mgmt work 0
you ca n t just reassign a wily silo to vivid if that project has released to wily in the
you need to branch for vivid in that case the idea is then that abaondoned landings get manually inspected by
generally i would recommend the dual silo but i guess gcc5 threw a wrench in those gears ok i got
what would be your suggestion the packages got copied to vivid o ok yeah that s why it s not
okay cool whatever the reason i m sure it can be figured out oh i guess we could take that
how about for source package uploads received 0
what about them they re handled manually so as long as you prepare the sources by hand then you can
ack makes sense 1
40 is for sure tone generator i do n t know but both of them have been rebuilt after the
trainguards ok so https requests ci train ubuntu com static dashboard html q ubuntu 2flanding 035 ok thing is gcc5
thanks ah ok in that case i can wait and rebuild once gcc5 is in the final destination 1
trainguards can you help please tone generator seems to just be c so i ll publish that one at least
nice thanks ubuntu touch meta has broken dev dependencies still too though 0
trainguards ok so https requests ci train ubuntu com static dashboard html q ubuntu 2flanding 035 for the other one
it seems there s also some issues with the boottest hardware provisioning i do n t think more uploads will
although generally speaking this is a bug in the dashboard it does n t highlight silos ready to publish like
the silos are managed by jenkins if you did n t run a jenkins job then nothing happened in the
nope looks like everything s correct even jenkins is bad having to click build on a job that does n
well they are set to merge in the stable branch of each project i guess i do n t understand
but based on what s being removed that s what i suspect so a wily version number is what exactly
ill email it over it s one that contains 15 10 yyyymmdd 1
yeah nik90 said it was broken all weekend so what if it s already been released with a 15 10
o trainguards can i get help to clean silo 031 and i need a new silo for oa but i
yes you need to change the changelog to have a vivid version number because making a 15 04 release after
change all of the previous ones that were for wily you mean hmm let me check with kyle photos scope
cihelp is anyone looking into the boottest failures that s holding up package migration i think it works if you
i did a quick upload to handle that and i think it fixed it ok great 1
ohh look it indeed it did so is it legal to just change 15 10 to 15 04 and wily
well it ll fool the train into working having changelog entries that do n t correspond to actual releases is
sure but what else would it be this is a sync that ll make a silo harder 0
i only see my photos facebook request to log in and flickr explore yeah it s fine 1
just trying to learn in general i m not a core dev so this is all new to me well
yeah do n t let the train rot your brain too much yeah ours do that wish i could get
gcc is known to be stuck how do you reconfigure after editing in the new silo request tool does it
no you need to click assign it reconfigures if it s already assigned looks like it fails to provision the
hm i seem to have lost my irc connection is it okay for me to push instagram to the store
also i d like to understand why it was pushed manually looks like asking for trouble which it caused btw
can that button change with context assign if new reconfigure if editing rvr thanks 0
the silos are managed by jenkins if you did n t run a jenkins job then nothing happened in the
can you request a new line with the mp s i d rather not have buttons that change names despite
var lib jenkins is full i m not really up on it apparently kenvandine had some fixes 1
i guess i m saying i do n t really want to see them at all we have a lot
to foundations subject why does he have that underscore argh even jenkins is bad having to click build on a
kenvandine i guess my real question is how long do we allow ourselves to be blocked with dual landings rather
alright i ll just request a new silo then exactly why i m just doing a vivid only landing for
well my understanding is that people need to branch for vivid anyway i m curious why you d say that
or instead it s rather frustrating not sure what the threshold should be 1
i have n t heard that so just bury head for a little bit more time 0
it s still running do n t it https ci train ubuntu com job ubuntu landing 032 1 build 11
or i guess that one is better as part of a silo gcc is known to be stuck 1
so just bury head for a little bit more time looking at master http 91 189 93 70 8080 job
thx i do n t know about qtcreator though you should probably reach out to people who know things 1
is the lts utopic backported stack supposed to actually work on i386 what do you mean 1

fwiw it worksforme on intel so fix it in the meantime 0
ok works on intel for me also well it s i686 on a amd64 host 0
there should be some egl libs in recommended that do n t get installed do you override cpu in your
that was the no network issue let me discuss this with slangasek it s not urgent 1
as is evident from the way that gccgo update has sat in the queue since november 2014 ok thanks 0
http paste ubuntu com 10620817 it says processing triggers etc before it fails 0
the pass it never installed upstart bin and only if you are logged in 1
yes that s where i am right 0
just tried the same test commenting the grub changes to boot to upstart and the reboot pass it uses git
hm yeah that s kind of the wrong test when what we care about is pid 1 but it should
so i guess one question is why are we enabling cgo on aarch64 in an sru you re still a
oh true but that inability aligns with the correct course of action doing nothing so it all works out do
well you need to look at console yes i m double checking the configuration of the other nodes then will
it s failed previously on aldebaran too and just comment the upstart test in debian test control 0
so you re saying that you can recreate pass of 219 4ubuntu5 and failure of 219 4ubuntu6 well udev fires
sorry no i meant this was already failing with 219 4ubuntu5 as well i wonder if the upstart job for
line 75 where i guess you are telling this because they all are conffiles right 0
debian tests cmdline upstart boot return 0 0
but something else changed the failure fails on installation of upstart bin anyway on my local adt it s clearly
did you try to reboot on a cloud image using upstart it would be perplexing for that to fail if
so i guess we should move some jobs to bin or a common package do you have handy some week
http paste ubuntu com 10621727 i ll look 1
apt get install upstart bin does not get upstart do we have ttys0 accessible 1
well you need to look at console so upstart would be jobs and binaries and upstart sysv would be the
so my worry here about overriding this is that it is in fact indicating that the one time boot with
ahah good catch i was thinking the upstart package was way more empty only the basic tools which means none
i guess you are telling this because they all are conffiles right no the failure was not on installation of
which just ca n t be expected to boot right 1
and only when rebooting with upstart yeah now that it s been root caused we can let it through 1
but libc bin postinst does n t use debconf can you run all the other tests locally 1
as host and previously when these things were passing upstart was installed 0
i might do that this afternoon oh sure as long as you have a vivid adt cloud image 1
and with systemd you surely are n t waiting for the static network up upstart event yeah i have a
when the pass never did the installation upstart bin is already the newest version ok i only gives debdiff against
to debug the problem with silo 18 you could do echo logginglevel 2 config signond conf then send me the
ok i m testing something else right now to workaround the problem but writing that down maybe those issues you
it s useful to know the bug we re fixing in the first place meanwhile i m trying with lower
you have ppu rights for oxide right start with the test case i added in bug 1421009 description so that

the loop is to be executed on the desktop right ok i ll continue with my mako then anyhow regardless
oh like section based so i could have network manager override with only content http pastebin ubuntu com 10877298 not
that should work yeah rvr hey any news on the ofono silo 0
a fix for what let me check that 0
things look better and better with our rc davidbarth mentioned there s a hypothetical fix in the works for stability
gdb bt since qa mentioned that webbrowser has really really broken tab functionality with 1 7 3 so i hoped
from what i can deduce override file is identical to a conf file and simply is executed instead of the
yeap next bug on my list is approved right 0
did they rebuild it and re handed over for testing osomon commented on them 1
i suppose it was something that was reported to osomon or davidbarth http paste ubuntu com 10878086 but i suppose
the removal of qml cache is supposed to simulate first boot from factory he did n t forward it to
but this is a webbrowser app feature oxide does n t have anything to do with the tab spread maybe
ah perhaps my publishing warning does n t apply to vivid because you re sending everything to the overlay ppa
i think it happened and thanks 0
yeah i am not sure five tries script errors out unity8 hanged 1
pmcgowan abeato after a rocky start silo 007 is good unlock attempt 1 failed script output error timeout was reached
can you copy paste the so far log to a file then grep passed file wc l looks similar to

ubuntu bug 1447606 in canonical system image incoming call ringtone is not played repeatedly critical in progress let me try
start with the test case i added in bug 1421009 description so that you can verify you can get the
i m not sure if it matters but it seemd the indentation is with tabs so i did it similarly
i have bad news although i need to go to sleep soon since i need to wake up in 7
so it seems a arale might be different beast b it s really fluctuating and 30 reboots after all is
http paste ubuntu com 10877628 this is my n m conf one sec 0
looks similar to what i tested i guess we ll need to collect info does ogra or jibel know i
and thanks if it rebooted then it s not the deadlock 1
btw did we have any confirmed cases of the hang happening on arale at all it does n t generate
let me check that the deadlock does not cause a crash so that must ve been something different 1
silo 2 what my krillin example i meant after a reboot i once had a black background on krillin and
anyway delaying metrics is kind of hard indeed that might make sense 1
how did that work presumably the overlay ppa has ddebs switched off too if you re still there with the
it seems our previous test case was not good enough so we need to have a real test case before
yeah i see it s locking on qdbusdispatchlocker indeed there was a branch from tvoss that was n t approved
http paste ubuntu com 10878086 but i suppose you have the same there was a branch from tvoss that was
yeah i updated the description looks the same now we at least have what to look for but we d
i do n t where bot went but you got silo 011 http paste ubuntu com 10877014 0
great thank you 1
correct it exists on the current vivid proposed image vg 0
try it first indeed so while thats not good it would say to me we can land 1 7 1
i think just an assumption as not previously reported for some reason the vibration fix just landed o 0
so lets see if we can land that silo now btw did you really mean to publish ubuntu keyboard ubuntu
hmmm i wonder why it is so smooth in the older version then so silo16 is good to go as
but we like evil 1
vg agreed will see where i can find more eyes on it 0
it s a change in code but this basically should n t require a re test i suppose things look
thanks nope is just adding a const to a method and some typos 1
anyway let s rebuild and re push 0
did you note my question about workarounds 2 5h ago or did your network eat it build done successfully no
how did that work presumably the overlay ppa has ddebs switched off too that was me being at lunch and
so i take delaying nm was n t good http paste ubuntu com 10879757 0
on that issue there is no fix cause the problem itself is not fully understood we could n t reproduce
you have ppu rights for oxide right you know it the best i was just guessing why they overlap 1
honestly i do n t know much more than you yeah i marked it 0
ok no worries just did n t know if i should ping again on monday done 1
a fix for what have you changed anything or it is me 1
thanks man i guess we ll need to collect info does ogra or jibel know i thought someone has tested
you re welcome i guess we ll need to collect info does ogra or jibel know i thought someone has
so yes what tool are you using that gave that error 1
i updated yesterday to vivid so maybe my phablet tools citrain is not the correct one on my krillin rtm
hm yeah i do n t see it in the priorities spreadsheet but i remember seeing the bug somewhere before
right so the thing is nothing changed in citrain script in many many months citrain calls phablet config phablet config
where did the error come from phablet config can you show me a paste of the command output anyway all
http paste ubuntu com 10879757 let me pastebin the whole backtrace bt not bt full 0
what image is flashed on your phone that sounds like you have an ancient version of add apt repository from
thing is this worked before thought it would be appreciated 0

silo 2 is alesage evil 0
hm yeah i do n t see it in the priorities spreadsheet but i remember seeing the bug somewhere before
awesome thanks when we have a test case in addition to qt 7 we might take my idea of adding
i m not sure if nm is only called when indicators are shown but optimally the deparallization would happen when
btw what magic could you do to make tsdgeos and maybe some people from unity8 help mirv with the unity8
agreed will see where i can find more eyes on it ok i ll never get used to checking the
well it was n t at the time i pinged but then sil2100 rammed it through saviq anyway for testing
the really really original bug report states what we know that sometimes a test fails because of the boot issue
yeah i am not sure oh like section based so i could have network manager override with only content http
mandel i had approved both branches on my krillin rtm i had a reboot when i had similar unity8 hang
no there was a branch from tvoss that was n t approved iirc 1
if you have a deadlock on boot the only reason we know is dbus but what tsdgeos said attach when
yes it s just that i did n t want weird stuff in the primary archive that gets sent out
the ppa would be named landing 026 ok no worries just did n t know if i should ping again
is that enough to validate that it s this dbus problem clearly a locking problem but can we get the
unlock attempt 1 failed script output error timeout was reached now the screen is on the main screen but without
ok it s very strange i ve seen this on 2 separate mp s only on 386 oh but this
if it rebooted then it s not the deadlock these builders are also used for mir which made me think
and thanks ok thanks 1
one sec all fine then 0
ok i ll never get used to checking the dashboard for the target you re welcome 1
hey yeah we ll reconfigure it for you in a moment thanks 0

any views on the play shuffle queue buttons mh 1
never seen someone so majestically drink a cup of coffee love the ad i try to import contacts using content

completely legit but if you want to have some perspective like the m vs m levelpacka and then additionally rotation
let s see about that clicks have a bit of a headstart hi yes back at home now 1
i have a question about tower behaviour if you have time but the listview proved useful when i wanted to
yeah for the next levelpack i want to do a rotating towers 1
see you ok i want to do the levelpack in the point of view like from above so would be
because it s quite pretty otherwise would some normal rotation work for you or would it require 8 sprite sets
hello i think it could be done with just one image 1
yeah no perspective it s to complicated its my preferred way its more flexible in my opinion 0

which makes the launcher matching work now with the running nautilus i just wanted to know what to uninstall to
do people even use all those features nautilus only lets you change associations no not explicitley remove them probably just
i did n t try but i guess it would make the dash list the one used in the launcher
in practice you just want to say open that type of file with this software hum right 1
killing off remove would solve so many open questions like this i m happy to use even if it does
i m wanting to avoid using initctl for now as it seems those things can be slow on the bq

i m happy to use even if it does n t match what other part of the code is doing

it tries to install some part of samba for the sharing i do n t have a context menu on

morning 1 or 2 here 0
you already answered a bit in the branch but would it be ok for u d f to use snapd
dammit only if snapd has setarch or similar 1
and extractsnap for the gadget as that has all the information on how to setup partitions which snaps to bring
this is where everything breaks btw as this snapd on the host would need to support 15 04 and rolling
not necessarily would n t an alias in the store do the same thing 0
right now we do snappy install to a fake location well snapcraft doesnt support it 0
they should n t be sideloaded right because of what you just said need to think about it a bit
oh fun so something returns 1 for size and parted assumes its a parameter shall we talk through the clinic
for the last step 1
we can do more if you like given all snaps i do n t know anymore 0
i see your point and yes it is confusing if you come from debian control right i think we need

i might be away for a month wish me luck sprint at mvo s the last week of october o

hey sergiusens any idea why golint is suddenly mad at my branch what changed in tarmac 1
beyond that the code looks fine to me will approve then and those parts will live in the wiki and
aha heh it does for me but i will double check after lunch again 1
wrt lint seems an updated golint is what happened this is probably related to the snapcraft tests line i added

right if it runs fine in ubuntu classic and you do n t forget to push the debs to tools

oh thanks sergiusens sounds like setrootdir set arch and a way to make apps not be sideloaded 1

it does feel like a crutch a little apps coming from the store should not be marked as sideloaded though

they should n t be sideloaded right because of what you just said yes its a version of snappy that

i think i mentioned i would very much appreciate help with that well python was on its way out of
how to install apps on snappy personal desktop so that they appear in the ux appbar but yes it is
in trunk i think build packages can even go into the part instead of top level snapcraft yaml ok here
i m not sure that s the right message i think that we should focus on debs being there for
insert i m wondering if i should just upload it without gdb etc since it would be nice if this
added comment to your mp 1 1
dammit and we add the other bits later 1
it makes it work personal i believe has mir bundled into the core 0
right i do n t have anything autopilot locally here yes 0
o s now no 0
yeah yup verifying by building now 1
so this looks a little weird i mean libfoo dev seems like it shoudl be a build package but yet
curious if it should be host packages or something this is probably related to the snapcraft tests line i added
oh i thought that was only for plugins or handle build packages by installing them onces but stage packages twice
i see your point and yes it is confusing if you come from debian control it is rather hard to
hey sergiusens i think of it as build package just drives the build 1
but note previous conversation between me and chipaca from earlier today stage packages is anything you want in the part
yeah i think it would be nice though just to make the snap smaller heh it does for me but
the current build packages sucks because if you re using a different distro version from the host it wo n
i asked to wait 1 week i e do the release with llp and no fileset usage i bet 1

problem is currently the running of the mir client snaps on top of that virtual machine manager which can download

i certainly believe we need more easter eggs in the phone next week is too soon to get a good

yes what you pushed seems nice to me it s just a question i d like to have answered for
i edited to make it fit thought 1 skip that test in schroot 2 turn off logs in that panic

i discarded docopt as it has no translations nor easy support for subcommands thanks d 0
if not it should be a bug right now we do snappy install to a fake location 0
sprint at mvo s the last week of october o nope was just double checking my thinking 1
it is rather hard to separate it so there are corner cases where the system stuff is picked up but
well the snappy fs isnt slow as you can see above ok i ll keep an eye out for it
so i was using mir s debian control file as a guide for dependencies is that ok ish or wrong
naughty why hi ping re killing click apparmor with fire p 0
also in line 80 root label writable you might want to use instead of hardcoding the name you use in
shall we talk through the clinic later on or are we good to go i think i d just snappify
that s ok but you buy into all the cruft debs bring in too those are depending packages that if
just to confirm there s a list i notice when i run stage called blacklisted from manifest packages and yes
question if you do snap run on the rp2 it tries also to run on an emulator sure and i
it s about the core level packages that are mostly taken care of by core like you do n t
1 those are depending packages that if installed will create havok you can explicitly call them out if wanted 1
tedg i noticed libstdc 6 is in the list i thot c stuff was n t in the core as
it is allowed today not sure about plans to block it virtual machine of ubuntu core not personal 0
did you see that ubuntu snappy is still on 1 5 in wily because 1 6 fails to build apparmor
i do not want to break people no jdstrand has an experimental ufw snap already so you should eb able
but note previous conversation between me and chipaca from earlier today yes tests have been made with only erle brain
lol well the move can be tied to the go absorption of policy generate ie no more python or not
considering resources i ll once again try to get it off the image then snappy devs can rewrite it whenever
try now https youtu be 0ma4wvppzcs 0
have n t tried that but i doubt that s the issue since debian fs works perfectly with the shield

when i saw it the first time i was quite stumped too check it is not black or a single
maybe the first seems better but what do you think i do n t know if this is a good
the reason is an old feature nobody actually uses honestly since i ve started trying to add autopilot tests to

the reason is an old feature nobody actually uses that s fair 0

it builds it s setuptools description from a few different files presumably one of them contains non ascii characters codecs

oh debian is way behind too and those did n t came 1
you can see the cmdline you re getting in proc anyway we should debug with him so this seems like
it s way behind then kenvandine said it ll come thru url dispatch as exec line would be a separate
lol must have been a writer i mean he said it would be a different topic to add d 1
yeah i am puzzled between exec line and uri depending on who i am talking sais different things d but

not a blocker since the project as a whole has an obvious license but you might want to fix upstream
also not a blocker but line wrapping in description fields does n t work the way you think it does

point me at both or just shove a new upload in the silo and we re good to go my
i might ask you to fix that one or argue why it s a good idea before you go writing

that is fantastic ahasenac note that a fix to 1486553 has landed in 1 24 0
will there be another half landed in 1 24 or will that part be in 1 25 marcoceppi https github
figuring that out now the other half is a little more tricky so we may put it into 1 25

b testing without installing those packages tox not a good one i m a python tools neophyte 1
otherwise package upgrade is of limited help you are the one who packaged cloud init 1
i have 2 different thing si need to support we use tox and tox reads requirements and test requirements 1
its kind of in both places i have a basic setup py here 0
fwiw been looking at cloudbase init for reference their using wmi and win32api both which are not part of stdlib
what is the reason why you want to avoid pywin32 probably not supported in rpm based 0
fwiw 1
https github com brmzkw dyntftpd blob master setup py right the networking bit is for linux as much as windows
you are the one who packaged cloud init in ubuntu it shoudl generally work 1
too bad running on rpm there should be an abstraction with a clear interface 0
i agree no you ca n t use the same work for another task 1

hmm once you ve done that you can also link lp to the upstream one 1

will probally do that after gci finishes wan na spend my free time atm on gci to have the best
i understand and thanks for the interest and welcome wanted to get some stuff approved before flocculant hopped off for

if not then you at least have a supported and relatively recent release 0
did that just happen 03 13 44 am matthewallen flocculant i m waiting for tsimonq2 to accept my task but
three of us are thinking it is a peculiar task i would just like a 4th opinion from an op
thanks well it was 3 in the morning p 1
i agree hahaha i was n t blaming you that s why i checked with him because i guessed you
wondering if either of these goot inspiration from the other wanted to get some stuff approved before flocculant hopped off
ok if you can confirm the bug and it s not upstream yet yes 0
np yes 1
can you please link to the task approved it 0
any clue 1
you too np 1
evil but true laney i filed bug 1423811 1
could be i guess are laney and i the only ones to see the issue 1
laney would be nice if you could confirm that you have exactly the same i e downgrading these four packages
no worries if not yeah we can totally backport it 0
i m fairly sure it s the same issue it woudl be too much of a coincidence 219 0
i can sort that out and then i ll start bisecting individual lib systemd systemd binaries 1
right i guess i should ve done that then i branched lp ubuntu evince well the hints come from gtk
pitti i got the boot issue once this morning but i m currently bisecting the changes 0
i get something funny in qemu as well i see the plymouth dots on top of my x session pitti
well i did boot twice with the new systemd without any issue i m not that good at the patch
what existing list happy friday btw 1
i do n t want to say but seb128 saw it first nothing is ubuntu only but the flavours have
do you need any help not sure how many reboots you are doing to qualify the bisection hereux vendredi 1
happy weekend joyeux vendredi aussi 1
keeping track in bug 1423811 oh 0
well i always used the archive version and so on 12 boots since i upgraded i only got the issue
obviously a race it also works fine with teh archive debs in a vm this is unity panel service http
phew i got it in a vm https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source systemd bug 1423811 comments 3 well i
no good interesting not sure how this is related as i did n t touch the journal for quite a
well reliable enough at least for me i have n t yet managed to get a reliable reproducer either when
phew i got it in a vm https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source systemd bug 1423811 comments 3 have fun
untiy7 is not interesting do you have unity panel service running 1
desktop phone ubuntu version desktop env clearly the diff is wrong 0
thanks larsu yes 1
desktop do you now have a way to reproduce 0
keeping track in bug 1423811 it s a bit finicky to reproduce but i now found a recipe that at
not everything sorry i got sidetracked by some other pings the target is what is isolated so remove other services
do you use persistant journal oh categories i do n t know exactly how that works but part comes from
debug shell tell us if you need help i m almost done with my backlog 1
wait that might not be the cheapest next step i can give it a try let me upgrade the vm
ok doing with that persistent journal but downloading a new iso for now argh it stopped being stalled after 60s
on qemu once on my system one as well as said this morning maybe g s d is n t
thanks a lot no fresh install 1
well i m unsure why my qemu does n t enable me doing that sorry man 1
desktop last saturday infact 1
could be heh not untrue 1
yeah this works what existing list 1
right i ll do a fresh install later then and see if it is fixed in that install disable the
where does it hang i occasionally get graphics lockups when i boot without quiet splash but that s something else
umm laney well it works 12 times in a raw here 1
well i m unsure why my qemu does n t enable me doing that it s a rather annoying bug
can i over ride them some how alt f9 works fine here in qemu you need to grab the keyboard
cya laney alt f9 does n t work here after grabbing the keyboard 1
either way i m fine with whatever you guys say prefer well it boots in the end 1
sorry ctrl shift d i had a certain success with https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source systemd bug 1423811 comments
do you have any indicator showing or menus i never had persistent journal but can try enabling that 1
do you have busybox static installed if not install it could be bug 1421117 yeah it s pretty random seems
it s not consistant enough to do that ah thanks for the reference doing 1
titlebars are handled by the wm and always removed afaik was already installed 1
the issue is that it ca n t open run log for writing thanks for the heads up 0
oh should n t break anything but i do n t know if how opening new windows works systemd bootchart
since you said i should ping you if i do n t get a response within a few days here
right it s a ui change for those folks ok bug report svp i ll write an autopkgtest for bootchart
and i keep leaving an sbuild j4 on my host to slow down things disable the target rather 1
hum to hide what confirmed will look after that boot failure 1
grrrr i ca n t get to any vt i m having the issue now hmmmm should that not of
masking failsafe x wfm well first read all changes to see which could be plausible candidates 0
the issue is that it ca n t open run log for writing we do n t do traditional releases
oh in any case tedg is the right guy to ask for releases 1
figured as much from the back log sorry too much backlog do you still need something 0
journactl systemd 1 looping too fast throttling execution a little but i ca n t see it 0
and so got the issue this morning i see 1
maybe i came into the convo late we did include the acl capabilities before 219 right 0
haha okay since indicator time is running for example 0
without releases that s rather hard waow it does 0
right talk to tedg about that i would not recommmend it but that s only me hum init lib systemd
happy friday seb128 one more thing will the evince patch find its way to ubuntu naturally or should can i
will find its way naturally if you re fine with waiting until we get 3 16 otherwise let s backport
ack enjoy continuing to bisect here ok so just that i learn something here 1 do n t add the
if it was relying on a flag it would work on every application a launchpad bug with one of us
that s why i asked you if it was an upgrade you re starting with a short round i hop
upstream bug already added to watch ofc i dropped the no debug from polkitd service 0
are you reliably reproducing it now but each letter is about an inch high 0
ok so it s not the tmpfile acl either good it s the 3rd time my physiologist told me to
let me know how you debug it was applied in the 3 15 branch 1
still please keep us updated on what you do and what you found ochosi i hesitated to put onto stable
i m seeing this in the logs right it s a ui change for those folks 1
and 0 upstart users you can but let s check whether that s the issue first do you have libgtk
not everything sorry i got sidetracked by some other pings open the inspector with ctrl d and select gtksettings on
bear in mind this is on a tablet inside xmir will installing that break much thank you for clarification btw
yeah i keep notes in the lp bug report oh should n t break anything but i do n t
irc is crazy today ok installed ctrl d doesnt do anything 1
ctrl shift d sorry oh hang on i forgot one more service 0
right i guess i should ve done that then i branched lp ubuntu evince in any case you can override
no such schema org gnome settings daemon plugins xsettings hey guys on vivid desktop i ca n t update via
so g s d is not installed hey laney 0
do i need to tell it to start inside the xmir session sounds good to me 0
i should probably look into our xmir setup a bit more to give better advice glad it works one more
morning yah we ll have to look in to this soon but soon not now 1
nah it works now wat the ubuntu packaging docs told me to add the pc folder and now the diff
sure one sec maybe i came into the convo late 0
so 15 04 is using the new release of gtk2 or patching an old release yeah it s a helluva
but i need to do some catchup on email and stuff first new one soon 1
ok bug report svp i ll write an autopkgtest for bootchart yes yes i would 1
see you pitti great 1
haha and no 0
just hanging for a while never read that cough 1
thanks later l 0
thanks a bunch wo n t that conflict with unity where they do hide titlebars for maximised apps 0
ok so just that i learn something here 1 do n t add the pc folder 2 correct mr destination
sorry too much backlog do you still need something so now i hope i can get the issue again somehow
where does it hang i occasionally get graphics lockups when i boot without quiet splash but that s something else
since indicator time is running for example oh maybe i want to create a new category in the drop down
i think i asked you this before and it s non trivial trying with debug no quiet no splash 0
oh categories i do n t know exactly how that works but part comes from the server since that s
do you have any indicator showing or menus kk nw i wont worry about it then 1
bisecting individual binaries now so 15 04 is using the new release of gtk2 or patching an old release 0
untiy7 is not interesting do you need any help not sure how many reboots you are doing to qualify the
i e the regression is not in systemd or systemd logind didrocks got it without persistant journal once too but
fwiw i did n t really get an issue that i noticed vivid 0
thank you for clarification btw so you would need the contrary systemd 218 journald alone from 219 1
to cross check yeah personally i get his request because i think the indicators are great and should n t
can do that in a bit yeah it s pretty random seems to happen more on heavy load 1
nah it works now doing that 1
do you now have a way to reproduce i think the idea was to get indicators playing nicely on other
i m still doing the reset v l j reinstall swap binary reboot a few times approach if that was
argh using bin bash configure gives different results than configure rebooting like crazy sometimes i have a hang which unblocked
oh and i think i still have the execstartpre bin sleep 1 in polkitd service and we probably have a
i do n t want to say but seb128 saw it first a bit hard to say 1
ok so just that i learn something here 1 do n t add the pc folder 2 correct mr destination
i m now running one vm with 219 and journald 218 and another vm with 218 and journald 219 no
oh o 1
ok something else to consider not sure why the default is n t taken when i was going to call
change of plans i will be here today oh 1
did you wait long enough to make sure it s really the same issue i e you get into the
yay got it too now launchpad bug 1423811 in systemd ubuntu 219 1ubuntu1 regression boot hangs logind fails critical in
seb128 or eaiser just wait until i have a fix and if things still go haywire for you you file
hm i had bet on logind but i disproved this already on qemu once on my system one as well
but journald makes it more plausible why i can trigger it with various sized persistant journals great 0
do you have time for another test wait i tried multiple reboots with upstart and got one hang 0
sure did you try reverting bisecting anything else just for keeping notes 0
i wonder if forwardtosyslog no makes a difference laney weekend 0
so we should be able to use journalctl from upstream trunk with explicitly setting forwardtosyslog yes in journald conf systemd
good idea wait that might not be the cheapest next step 1
might be better to split the bisecting into two halves sorry ctrl shift d 0
for src journal did you know that int item works on gvariant 0
so g s d is not installed well first read all changes to see which could be plausible candidates 1
ok let s do that then and maybe split the candidates between us but i got the exact same behavior
we did include the acl capabilities before 219 right sorry man 0
otherwise i d be in ubuntu touch d yes just that 218 did n t have the tmpfiles d acl
i sent a message to the upstream ml as a heads up let me reboot 0
ah saw michael s answer 1
and so got the issue this morning back from meeting 1
i sent a message to the upstream ml as a heads up yeah i doubt we ll dig deeper now
yeah definitively ca n t here c est l heure de la glace 1
did you try reverting bisecting anything else just for keeping notes keeping track in bug 1423811 0
i m sure i will run slowly though no i did backlog on what i planned for ubuntu make started
sweet5hark when i open writer in one display and i try to open calc in a different one lo actually
yeah until yesterday 219 1ubuntu1 was humming away fine for me too yeah vivid 1
there s a chromium landing in the ppa i mentioned that i would like you to try over the weekend
should be ready in the next 30 minutes he s debugging 0
but i ca n t see it sweet can do 1
if it was relying on a flag it would work on every application i m still confused which version is
libindicator indicator ng h is not yet released hmmm 0
i have a hunch that this is related to the new acl tmpfiles d feature by released do you mean
i would n t describe them as ubuntu only but i m not sure anyone else has them masking failsafe
so having a persistant journal is not the trigger but it helps on my systems at least sure on the
that is something i was considering as a fallback i agree that this may be a good solution ok installed

s libc libc dev the reverse dep calculation does 1
but we wait until var lib cloud instance boot finished exists so it should be done http bazaar launchpad net
hrm curious what would that have affected other than autopkgtest triggers i wonder you mean tp qt5 and it s
if it was horribly broken you d think we d have noticed later i can of course 0
well it just did n t consider a depends python any in rdepends so any installability check etc would ignore
i did n t explicitly give one it just seemed to default to the name of nova boot installability checks
adt run apt pocket proposed u content hub qemu adt wily amd64 cloud img perhaps it might have tripped up
hahaha ipython does n t have m a allowed 1
but a package without m a can have a depends foo any no no python does 1
sure the point is that for installability checks you need the full dep a stripped version is a lie thanks
umm mmkay 1
cause then they d suddenly be wrong you do n t happen to know the debian britney2 tests suite i
not sure how to make the testsuite go i ll check the makefiles for the command which triggers the bug
if it was horribly broken you d think we d have noticed do we trigger on rbuilddeps too or just
so far in old and new infra only on rdeps probably the ppa page says glibmm2 4 2 45 41
anyhow if rbuilddeps were ever in the cards you d have to worry about both any and native http paste
if there s only these two i think split 0 is better ca n t ever occur in a package
is a kernel dev here yeah that s what i did in the old skool sbuild fork since i did
made life much simpler to just ignore m a and pretend it was n t a thing but if i
ah got the tests to work still all pass this is a much more useful view than the old jenkins
fixing in gstreamer or thumbnailer i asked because the kernel team is rolling out the 4 2 rebase it is
it does n t cover any stuff right now yes 39 would be fine 1
yeah i have n t dug into it yet need to dig out the bits to reproduce it glibmm2 4
sec on the phone is n t it that this hostname error causes sudo to fail 0
rdepends is also being used in is that not used for installability checks so there you can look at the
please could you merge the new glibmm2 4 into silo 39 anyway the above commit does not actually filter them
do you want auto sync disabled now then ca n t think that the hostname matters so much unless i
sent kees i m in europe this week might be easier to chat next week when i m back in
yes would be good britney s meant to be growing actual ma support soon anyway 0
ah instead of true done 1
right it does ta and i had to do a glib networking rebuild in the ppa 1
will you nmu these renames ack just wanted to make sure you re aware as email notification is n t
nmu where while compiling cyanogenmod 0
i used name adt test to avoid interfering with the running tests silly me hmm still stunned about https objectstorage
it looks like cloud init is n t done yet at this point and the host name is still ubuntu
it s happening through multiple retries heya 0
http autopkgtest ubuntu com packages u ubuntu system settings online accounts wily amd64 and i386 failed four times in a
is n t it that this hostname error causes sudo to fail but if i run it manually on teh
yeah no idea but we wait until var lib cloud instance boot finished exists so it should be done 0
which means cross arch deps without hacks maybe some clue on the console 1
i guess my first step will be to make it fail with 16 instead of 20 and then think how
can you please report this as a bug with the complete dmesg and reproducer while compiling cyanogenmod 0
why not it was a question if building does n t show the full command line but uses quiet output
is there any reason the security sru of apport version 2 14 1 0ubuntu3 11 would be producing less informative
bin ip is not a suid sgid program behaviour for normal 755 executables should n t have changed since his
i e i do n t see a reason yeah i have n t dug into it yet need to
although wait tell me the output from the thing you patched does n t get fed to the bits colin
what does less informative mean here the security update would cause suid sgid programs to not get a report at
the reports for iproute2 are incomplete particularly missing stacktraceaddresssignature hopefully this is actually justified in most cases but if it
sec on the phone example here https errors ubuntu com oops 1b8c3c20 3607 11e5 89c7 fa163e525ba7 1
do we have a core dump for those maybe it s truncated or even 0 bytes in fact you re
no we do n t ask for a coredump if there is no sas and its not on armhf python
do you want auto sync disabled now then it seems the limit is 64 chars 1
cool hostname adt works fine so no ideas about iproute2 crashes other than truncated crashes 1
i used name adt test to avoid interfering with the running tests silly me i m sitting here since hours
looks like it does no i m afraid i tried ip route killall segv ip in a loop but that
could just be unlucky i used ip monitor and got a good crash 1
that also explains ruby rails assets markdown it diaspora mention and the other funny long one which i still think
fyi new apparmor seems to break content hub http people canonical com ubuntu archive proposed migration html apparmor you can
yes looks ok but if i give my instance a very long name it ll overflow hostname s 64 char
anyhow if rbuilddeps were ever in the cards you d have to worry about both any and native i do
but when reading the depends field which includes the any it currenlty tests whether that value is a known package

surely that would be be coooooool not be calm so to test the mir update it installs only mir 0
followed by heeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyy and not forcing u s c the be updated with mir 0
lightdm and unity system compositor logs probably hahaha mini moto now i have an image of you something like this
see regression potential in the report i m looking at it right now and scratching my head because neither gnome
i was n t sure it did n t seem like too much work as long as debian catches up
and not forcing u s c the be updated with mir i assume it s just because the gimp maintainer
i got to wondering how many packages did you guys wind up systemdifying before the vivid release i suspect i
for some rough numbers we can compare http people canonical com jhunt systemd packages to convert 2014 11 13 txt
is that really 191 5 186 packages from main and 962 6 956 packages from universe wgrant runs that 0
so 46 packages from main 63 from universe auto sync has copied everything now 0
still that s amazing jibel sent an rt to create the wily view on public jenkins no idea whether that
just need a ton of bisecting i d say i personally fixed maybe 10 universe packages most of them came
main was mostly on our table though as we had a lot of upstart only packages there makes sense 0
heh yes i ve been busy and thanks again to didrocks he also helped with this i think it will
yes impressive thanks for humouring my curiosity 1
hmm note that s not accurate for any statistics we started with the conversion way before but the magnitude sounds
makes sense blacklisting ghc would not help that cause 0
yeah that was to get four green dots back err wat 1
nevermind all sorted out session restart fixes it 0
tzdata was pre installed in the vms from vivid updates but vivid had a newer version than wily in one
pitti hum ah ha yeah i know the archive was n t broken p 1
but this reminds me that it s probably time to turn on auto sync yeah it definitely sounds like it
http www sudo ws repos sudo rev e9dc28c7db60 seach for the man page description yeah let s get some new
auto sync on let s see how that goes fun incoming 1
yeah britney etc seems to work fine i had quite some argument with her this morning 1
by pre dist upgrading to updates we save the majority of per test dist upgrade time work mostly the reminder
yeah that was to get four green dots back mhall119 fwiw i do n t think we need that many
auto sync on let s see how that goes must some control freak issue 0
copy paste from your url bar going back to your tzdata oops why do your vms have updates installed in
because we have to cheat and dist upgrade a vivid vm so the usual deal 0
what does dpkg l initscripts give you please until we get proper wily image builds cloud images in particular 1
sure i meant why do the vivid ones have updates installed and the canonical imap 0
i guess since we only use them for srus it makes sense thanks that s checked 0
i live in a world where security is a thing so none of my chroots have updates in the base
yeah it makes perfect sense until we end up trying to use this machinery for security which we ve never
do n t we fold updates into the next security upload anyway oh i meant locally i assumed it was
it s a i915 bug probably just a pageflip less with the menu we do but it still builds only
so for instance a library with new symbols in updates might have binaries in updates that depend on it but
anyhow i think the separation especially given the base security uploads on the last sru policy is probably pointless and
yeah over the years i shifted my mind to security u c is just a faster mirror mostly on haswell
see if there really is a completely stable only security use case we should have done that check dmesg if
more specific but we did n t 1
thanks that s checked and the current policy is just a bit odd 1
but not everyone gets the memo and sometimes people do micro release srus that just happen to also fix 27
yes but it s an oem bug it s supposed to do the same 1
ah so at least you can run trusty with the lts vivid backported kernel i m also less and less
yes but it s an oem bug noskcaj edit acl p noskcaj query from bzr lp ubuntu archive tools 0
do you know if that s a video issue no 0
i sometimes get something similar but usually ctrl l helps ok 0
ironlake gen5 from xorg log that looks likely to be an issue with sysvinit not ifupdown why was initscripts not
yes i know here too i just press it i m usually in gnome terminal it helps here bah and
i m interested to know whether apt get f install complains about anything before attempting the upgrade yes 1
session restart fixes it ok fixed now 0
yes i know here too i just press it i m usually in gnome terminal it helps here well it

it was a brand new box came per installed 1
i m interested to know whether apt get f install complains about anything before attempting the upgrade ok 0
i do n t know why it annoys me when people sync my debian uploads to ubuntu for me but
is that expected it does n t complain or it does and fixes the issue and this is all before
put the output in the bug so the usual deal 0
ok but did you run this after or before the upgrade attempt err the config is set false sorry its
any idea how that made it past britney s installabilty checks after 1
what does dpkg l initscripts give you please then it does its thing and one can dist upgrade again 1
what does dpkg l initscripts give you please one thing i wanted to mention is if any of the full
do n t have access to my machine right now ah that s the url i want thanks laney the
http cdimage ubuntu com ubuntu releases 14 04 release ubuntu 14 04 server amd64 mac list yeah over the years
i wanted to know configuration status of that package before and after the upgrade failure i do n t know
why is kfreebsd relevant here the full log of the upgrade would be helpful too i wonder if it s
blacklisting ghc would not help that cause that s a lot of packages hehe 0
right jibel sent an rt to create the wily view on public jenkins no idea whether that also needs action
it s either that the test is not stable wrong or something really needs to change given the number of
should n t the emails be sent after the publishing when the log has there because we have to cheat
i m interested to know whether apt get f install complains about anything before attempting the upgrade this job finished
maybe but we do n t control the public jenkins dholbach mode yee haw 0
i think it will get auto copied but in any case i plan an upload in debian soonish so i
the sync to the public instance can take several minutes up to several long minutes if there are big attachments
because there s a bug in trusty that only happens with the hotkey pitti thanks 1
how do you mean shrug and of course activating the vpn makes everything else timeout stop working i had forgotten
dunno if i misconfigured the vpn in nm connection editor but when i activate it from there the non vpn
wily adt samba build 1 failure does your default route go via vpn now that would explain it 1
do n t use the vpn as your default route dunno if i misconfigured the vpn in nm connection editor
in nm select the vpn ipv4 settings routes x only use for resources of this network yeah it makes perfect
thanks that s checked the fix there 0
ok default route points to your normal router not vpn so tzdata java was only available for an older version
oh wait you mean the mksbuild command from ubuntu dev tools correct 1
then a few times in a cycle we could generate them for different locales and even for different devices ah
do we actually have that already ok that sounds plausible 1
we do but it still builds only against security and release the conclusion was that we should build a prototype
yeah mhall119 will come up with a prototype britney etc seems to work fine i had quite some argument with
i do n t know why it annoys me when people sync my debian uploads to ubuntu for me but
in fact this time it did n t make the interweb stop working diffs to the docs 1
yes how was it installed 0
it s fixed in 3 19 at least i was hoping the docs team would help you guys update them
sure but then before publishing them utlemming sorry i do n t know question for infinity or cjwatson perhaps 0
sure but then before publishing them you likely want a sanity pass 1
http www sudo ws repos sudo rev e9dc28c7db60 seach for the man page description then a few times in a

mzanetti mhall119 it s also worth thinking about videos yeah 0
totally apt get install tzdata java 0
and yeah totally nevermind all sorted out 0
it d likely be useful to also be able to only take a screenshot of a certain region launcher screenshot
hehe i sometimes get something similar but usually ctrl l helps 0
ok but did you run this after or before the upgrade attempt what do you jmean 1
yeah mhall119 will come up with a prototype you have to add a special flag 1
do n t see it in unapproved at any rate http www sudo ws repos sudo rev e9dc28c7db60 seach for

oh thanks i ll try during the week 1
maybe check the xda forums for porting your device anyway that uses doodle as the picker with content hub 0
sure is there any apps using this that i can test against iirc it was being used in messaging app
yeah well i think that s how it ll usually be used not really 1
presumably without the sdk part it still should fix the statesaver issue though since its now going through the uri
it should be calendar something the same thing evolution already uses so if i write a quick test app that
turns out that was working out of luck we do n t hide desktop files 0
so ignoring my review comments and approving settings changes anyway adbd is running i can adb shell and adb logcat
ubuntu bug 1426519 in indicator datetime ubuntu need a mechanism for specifying what happens when an ical menuitem is clicked
sure yeah jgdx could also easily revert that 1 line in the mr p 1
initrd mounting system img user mode you want it back to wrong p 1
kenvandine no big deal but random spacing changes in unrelated mrs screw bzr blame and logs app author s choice
or at least it use to i would rather have that line associated with a fix spacing commit than with
i can do that kenvandine they have ini files but not desktop ones 0
you had a spurious change in it just white space that seb128 had wanted fixed because associating code with unrelated
lol at some point the kernel should mount the ubuntu container right 0
that is my current log haaaha 1
oh right thinko thanks signon ui does 0
nothing you can see yet 0 err it transforms tabs into spaces as well was that what you meant 1
so that when i click a link in irc it opens the app instead of the browser or if i
yes i m not sure why you re insisting on three 0
sure thx 1
nik90 sorry guys i had some business today afternoon i m here for a short time which i think is
an event is an event if you tap on the event it will go to the event in the calendar
nik90 mentioned that we should talk to you about the former relating to https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source ubuntu
not saying he is n t a qml expert yes i started some code for that but then i saw
but when i go to run make or make oldconfig the config file gets completely re written so far i
and that si not future proof enough thinking of the new backend we wil have o 0
and you open it and it does nothing 1
wfm nik90 we have the urihandler clock app could use that to intercept the call from i dt 1
so you can launch the app with upstart right i ran into issues trying to rebuild my kernel 0
they get generated though yeah it ll be launched through calling 1
not really that s why i d prefer that datetime be fed a url rather than an id so that
uhm i m not sure we woudl need to specify any special url mariogrip thanks for the help i ll
not for alarms it would n t correct but you really want 3 or zero here 0
well you could make it alarm uuid or whatever instead i m happy for the file format to be a
let me rebuild my kernel what if there would be a separate tag specifying the app as well you then
language is confusing here because the words are so overloaded and you open it and it does nothing 0
they ll just get the signal and arg passed if we re talking about a reminder that was created in
i think if you want to treat actual alarms specially in this regard then it should be alarm foo and
i thought the reminders app was notes aka evernote what about exporters that do n t have applications 0
i think then how does one handle multiple apps handing alarms created by them we dont want i dt launching
then it would open the app but not the item in the app if a url is missing we d
one would be clock and one would be myapp so apps do n t even see it 0
evernote reminders app should probably be the https evernote com whatever url what is the world coming to 0
zsombi then we assign one of the alarm tag url values as app id alarm id this way i dt
yep just commenting on the bug that would be mzanetti s call 1
well we are also passing the alarm id which the app can then parse and take it to the correct
ubuntulistview listitem expandable example http askubuntu com q 597672 yes some make bad choices 1
i only need to figure out the exec line for imports you ca n t pass the alarm id in
we should document this as the recommended way i think we do n t hide desktop files 0
oh right thinko thanks so alarm alarm id 1
i think you re right sure but from datetime s perspective it s all opaque 0
you ll need to be able to implement the same thing on other toolkits and passing i url is silly
that s done with a url dispatcher hook that s what i had originally wanted 0
i find it s easier to talk about that way people do n t think things are urls without a
app author s choice maybe check the xda forums for porting your device 0
the only reason file needs the third slash is because on sane file systems is the root of the path
sure makes sense but i think we should n t admit it publicly partially i think in the specific case
ubuntu bug 1431384 in indicator datetime ubuntu need a mechanism for specifying an ical event s icon medium confirmed the
create a separate app in the click package exactly it should use the same thing we ve been using for
for instance qturl wo n t let you use capital letters there thanks 0
domain names ca n t start with a slash yeah so they ll have a desktop file 0
the sdk is going to filter that out 1 1
i have n t seen an app using content hub except those by qml experts ideally this will be opaque
yap coming sure makes sense but i think we should n t admit it publicly 1
that s how datetime launches evolution now with evolution calendar startdate y m dt h m sz but in the
well xdg should be able to handle calendar fine i think 0
that does it yeah that is a bit nasty annoying though 1
i think we ll only have separate exec lines for imports what s the better way 1
not on trunk https developer ubuntu com en apps platform guides url dispatcher guide 1
dobey i need in one test to launch a test app with a special uri which disables the statesaver 1
so that when i click a link in irc it opens the app instead of the browser or if i
an autopilot test you have to have the context switching internally and handle the cases 0
it s too easy for tedg an ap test yes which should launch a simple test app created otf 1
something needs to be an app or not apps being hidden means they end up in a grey area of
well that s the only place that mentions editing the kernel config the uri response could be state specific 1
if it only has to work on vivid maybe look at using ubuntu app test to launch such an app
not really well the issue is with teh contenthub we agreed with kenvandine that he will launch the app with
not decided yet if it only has to work on vivid maybe look at using ubuntu app test to launch
there was no exec line but kenvandine added this uri we want to keep the uitk cleen from dependencies brazil
it seems like it d be better to pass as a parameter than trying to parse a url we are

ls by parameter you mean argument 1
nothing you can see yet 0 choose doodle 0
dynamic object creation im qml http askubuntu com q 597613 what do you think of that 1
i did not where can i see it spring break 1
super exciting though ok 0
ok let s do it so we have components for apps to parse the arguments so disabling can also be
which is all i did but in both cases you could start from a running app for example in messaging
i attempted to boot with one of the other kernels maybe mako but it was n t successful scopes are
default idle timeout is 10 seconds did we drop the having a specific exec line 0
no why would it 1
it seems like it d be better to pass as a parameter than trying to parse a url are n
ual is so good i m not allowed to bring it within 500 feet of elementary schools heh 0
yeah that s what i think oh i see your point yes it would be better to use the id
std map solved lol 1
oh oh maybe we can get a better location than london then it should be calendar 0
haaaha i just want to keep this simple for app developers the 90 case 1
it s really not that hard we do it in a bunch of apps already personally i think that s
you have to have the context switching internally and handle the cases i have n t seen an app using
vs having a single qml file for each case so in that case they use the same exec line but
check g it should be calendar something the same thing evolution already uses 0

it ll take some time of course the ultimate target is to upstream your plugin to the main qtc specially
it means that ubuntu sdk will not depend on the distro qt packages but it will be a compact qtc
the problem is that with 15 10 the qt will be on 5 5 or even newer when the lts
so the goal is to have the sdk up to snuff for all lts s hah 0
the developers wil hardly realize the difference the bonus is that the ubuntu sdk will just work on debian fedora
yes lts is lts we must provide sdk bits to developers who are using lts it might not look like

apparently the tardis operates on 4 aaa batteries in a vm the hardware wifi on the host appears as wired
thing is we can get cheap integration with qt5 so maybe it s just me other testers seem fine too
so clone the archive branch locally but i ve always bern scared to integrate it too much with anything the
clone calligra checkout master git checkout b ready for the 2 9 8 work have you packaged 2 9 8
the thing is i did twiddle with the code and hardcoded an upgrade to vivid for simulation purposes and that

the way user credentials are managed in juju 2 0 should help this a bit i think we ll talk
bdx juat got off the phone with the folks doong that work just interested if anyone has a service upgrade
yeah thanks for that i m pumped for 2 0 and i do n t even know any details 1
glad to hear it bdx we ll support both externalnauth files and per user juju credentials that ll fix this
awesome we should have a juju 2 0 features talk at the summit the goal is to split the cloud
definitely let us know if we can help with access stuff fwiw there is some early user control stuff in

getting it dialed feedback isnalways great to have early and often 1
epic 1
everything i ve seen just says to update the release name in the charm 2 0 alpha1 will have support
i think alexisb or were going to publish a roadmap to the list i think there s still some finalizations
and yes the plan is to have juju 2 0 in xenial and then backported to trusty feedback isnalways great
you just need to know how to auth to juju itself ans ask it to do things awesome 1
i m your man probably not that early the work is just starting and the first work is some stuff
ok i ll be looking out i know i m excited about it and a lot of us are looking
the goal is to split the cloud definitions files from the user credentials from the actual juju user it s
okay so this is for getting users to connect to a juju environment e g if i bootstrap and share
you just need to know how to auth to juju itself ans ask it to do things now 0
so the work will start on the cloud end and the sharing part will be later on top of that
that makes total sense considering what i just went through sorting the secrets and determining which ones are pertinent to

http pad ubuntu com testing snappy k i m using vivid the ppa maybe that s not uptodate enough 0
what happens if a service has no description with hardware access and all the permissions 0
a good question using that is probably not a great idea and i guess all the uefi confusion was because
maybe we should just generate something like service for pkgname servicename or something how do you want to change the
service servicename of qualified name right 0
yeah much better the store converts svg to png and i do n t think we should allow svg 0
and the node snapper mp and tooling is good 0
amd64 ubuntu localhost apps chatroom sideload current amd64 bin nodejs current site server js no chatroom 1
my brain is still on this gccgo senfile failure but i think i nailed it now i feel a bit
as it s not just applicable to snappy of course that s good right 1
well there is a lot in the store for chatroom its good that its fixed not good that i feel
it seems that name executable are not working quite well and assumptions are made that name is identical to executable
looks like it s currently spec ed that way cf https bazaar launchpad net snappy dev snappy snappy view head
can you kick me or something we build two of them in and put them in directories appropriate for the
plus py2 blech i m alone in the conversation 1
who uses containers meh let me know if i can help in any way 1
crazy shit now i m alone in the conversation 1
who makes the calls lets go to hangouts this does n t seem ready https plus google com hangouts grwijm4jm7pbk5vu6fg5dgiknaa
ok still no dice 1
how can i emulate the startup of the service why not the store description 0
show me your start service sh yep i did 0
the path to the server js is wrong drop the current there could it be that amd64 would help there
snapcraft is in the design phase right now or vapourware if you will i think we do we could kill
do you know why the icon section says only svg ok i ll have another look 1
also show me your start service sh one thing i m interested in is this use case 0
i ll start from scratch i was just following your instructions without a solution like qemu arm static or simiar
bug 1461243 it works 1
sergiusens i had the previous binary copied over to try something and i forgot about it looking 1
sure we want to not rely on the base interpreter but that s tractable i think oh you can kill
just to be sure you understand it frameworks are for hardware access not for sharing libraries looks like a good
i just wanted to show you plainbox snappyified i can kill snappy systemd i mean 1
yes that is only used by the snappy systemd hook which is no longer in use at all ie we
so binaries and services look identical yep 0
only by editing it before rolling the snap snapcraft is in the design phase right now or vapourware if you
naw i ll just copy it into my package the file is owned by root 1
yes yes that is only used by the snappy systemd hook which is no longer in use at all 0
thanks reviewlist 0
i dont really like the hack in point 6 where i mv the contents of chatroom i wonder if we
dholbach should i attend that meeting the plan is for snappy to provide a rest api which everything that wants
can i write an app that talks to webdm and it will not be broken down the line try dropping
thanks and sorry again ask sergio he designs that 1
will do thanks i m just after a yes no answer 0
and down the line do you see it becoming a framework of sorts so that people can do 2 7
thanks and sorry again or will it be killed 1
i see which blocks me for working on the new unity8 desktop snappy iso 0
https code launchpad net stephen stewart webdm tidy up banner merge 260836 no reviews less than a day old so
are frameworks well defined is it okay for a framework to ship a language runtime thanks beowulf 0
python tutorial nope is that discussion happening somewhere 1
how do you want to change the permissions it solves the problem how to assemble a complete python dependency tree
yes you can side load let me find the relevant docs who makes the calls 1
ok i ll start showing up in yours not sure if that was the wrong way to do it 0
is app to app ipc constrained or shall i just go and write the docs so people use sudo to
it s a dream oh i see why that happens because you chaned world writability 1
ah yes that s right right but they are all using the ppa right 0
feeling silly is good so maybe just change it to user once node snapper is done 1
https developer ubuntu com en snappy tutorials node to snap looking good https code launchpad net stephen stewart webdm link
still store afaik in a meeting gim me a bit 1
you want details about one of the partitions sure 1
i ll hold off of blogging about it for a bit you around 0
the last paragraph has n t formatted with a p i know theory that it can work i want to
thats what you get with the intel snap i m just after a yes no answer 0
i dont really like the hack in point 6 where i mv the contents of chatroom i wonder if we
iso yep fixed now 1
but thats only cosmetic looks great otherwise is there any sort of incompatibility with current ubuntu device flash related with
let me think about it the only bit missing is the description to tell the user it s chromium only
do you mind if i make a small layout tweak to your tuto i do n t know what the
i d be happy if you d do that d which you have in the store 0
specifically code twelve col yes you just need to set allow unauthenticated to avoid it checking for the store key
a magic wand 0
meh let me know if i can help in any way it s the tool we re working on to
handle things like pulling in a runtime and packaging it along with your app thanks 0
no pulse should really be a framework it s something that shares hardware ok so not an iso 0
for a hardware testing tool i d expect it to be unconstrained or have a custom apparmor profile confusing http
frameworks are more about services that multiplex hw o yes for snappy 0
i thought barry did one tedg that both makes sense thanks 1
just to be sure you understand it frameworks are for hardware access not for sharing libraries are frameworks well defined
having a library in a framework will not enable things that depend on that framework to use that library can
yes i get that it s just not clear to me exactly if there will be exactly zero non hardware
one other idea i had is to have a flag day and rewrite on top of some qt api ok
snappy remote url ssh you device install hello 0 snap is snapcraft something that i can try now 1
currently we re using the second line of the readme for that no 1
snapcraft is in the design phase right now or vapourware if you will i kind of like snappy 0
his is py27 based i m firmly py3 but if you use some mechanism to bundle your stuff let the
i think we do we could kill it how do you plan on achieving that 1
magic wand ah so ubuntu component store for snappy kind of 0
or the snapcraft tool could be apparmor aware and change to a profile for the plugin and in reality 1
http pastebin ubuntu com 11516757 i guess something is happening one thing i m interested in is this use case
you pip install somethig because it only happens after the aha 0
that builds a so file super hard and not working for everything but 3 5 its clearly the future but
curious is there a trello card for the docs team to do the tutorial i mentioned on the list and
we build two of them in and put them in directories appropriate for the architecture they re built for that
s but and hmm 1
i mean pip do you plan to patch pip and python to make that work yeah 0
i know theory that it can work i want to understand if you have any concrete plans for specific cases
plus py2 blech all python extension build natively so far 1
there is a click way beowulf just needs to hook to the ui did you add the ui port we
without a solution like qemu arm static or simiar can you pull from lp dholbach junk chatroom 0
it s the tool we re working on to make building snaps really easy we plan to cross compile in
i m hoping we do n t have to patch pip but if so we ll work with upstream to
tedg i d love to dogfood anything you can share my use cases are stuff like python3 lxml2 https code
yup they all use the ppa i agree 1
note that an eula is hardly needed for gnu hello frameworks are more about services that multiplex hw 0
i m checking the changelog for 0 20snappy7 0ubuntu1 2 now but to my knowledge support for uefi lands in
barry i was looking at barry s blog post but it looks like asac preferred ricmm s approach https code
python 3 5 is n t required for my approach it just enables some fancy debugging and hackery sudo ubuntu
sure let many flowers bloom happy to help cute 0
tl dr could you please release ubuntu device flash with the uefi support or is somethng blocking and if so
good morning the point dholbach tries to solve if giving developers something in their hands right now 1
sure we want to not rely on the base interpreter but that s tractable i think nope thanks 1
we build two of them in and put them in directories appropriate for the architecture they re built for certainly
there have been lots of upstream discussion around this approach have a nice evening bye 0
it s just that i d like to see upstream work continue i d like us to drive that so
as of this minute webdm does n t provide links to external ui but i do n t know what
without a solution like qemu arm static or simiar maybe sergiusens looks in the readme if there s nothing in
what is snapcraft yes so i see 1
yup let me check what s happening there so 1 on removing it from snappy 0
a magic wand hmm thats pretty bad now that we dont have a click way to get to the used
https code launchpad net stephen stewart webdm link to external ui merge 260833 https code launchpad net stephen stewart webdm
looks like it s currently spec ed that way cf https bazaar launchpad net snappy dev snappy snappy view head
it gives me channel edge not found on server http system image ubuntu com just need to hook up in
i assume it can be a framework or you can just bundle it the only bit missing is the description
frameworks are more about services that multiplex hw which you have in the store 1
maybe we should just generate something like service for pkgname servicename or something right 1
i guess we can add a http webdm local 4200 api v2 packages chatroom ogra documentation that exposes the readme
why not the store description let me check 0
i tried googling for it but the name kind of hits minecraft instead 1
awesome thanks i m checking the changelog for 0 20snappy7 0ubuntu1 2 now but to my knowledge support for uefi
is there a proposed text already indeed you are right 0
you pip install somethig i was starting to work from http www wefearchange org 2015 04 creating python snaps html
for ricmm s example we basically just have the code is there a way we could give a utility access
that thing is far too complex imo yes so i see 0
where right but we should definitely not suggest to people to rely on the py interpreter in core 1
barry just clarified the 3 5 bits are for additional debugging all python extension build natively so far 0
now i can patch that but i feel i should not have to ok 0
only the toplevel is restricted but tmpdir always points to the app dir anyway so we either take barry s
yes and that s what i m talking about yeah much better 0
obviously we could rewrite that to build our stuff but then it s a bit more complicated cross compiling and
do n t we use namespace for devices already python tutorial nope 0
how do i get it tedg i d love to dogfood anything you can share my use cases are stuff
let me check sorry which tutorial 1
yep no worries 0
i can give you the snap if you want to https developer ubuntu com en snappy guides security policy has
then kill it and start over sergiusens i had the previous binary copied over to try something and i forgot
thanks and sorry again no tests in this no 0
thanks meh 1
now it succeeds yeah 1
i think we re determining how it could work so if you think it should n t work like that
k thanks unless 0
iso or disk image o so i mentioned to sergio the goal to have every request to the store being
i created an iso today using u d f 0 20snappy7 0ubuntu1 2 calling udf core rolling channel edge o
right but they are all using the ppa right thanks and sorry for the lack of reviews 1
naw i ll just copy it into my package http pastebin ubuntu com 11516978 0
bug 1461243 we do use a few containery techniques though 0
i agree is there a way we could give a utility access to a specific directory 1
hello the use case is that we have this snapcraft tool which will call other plugins for a language but
it d be nice if we did n t have to give them full access to everything but instead snapcraft
the mail is just my ramblings sorry for making it hard to read snappy chowns everything to the clickpkg user
but you cant just run it withouth the ubuntu core launcher environment use systemctl and syslog i just wanted to
https developer ubuntu com en snappy guides appliance builder guide webcam and ask if the name sideload vs name could
https code launchpad net mvo snappy snappy more errors 15 04 merge 260111 no reviews 6 days old not really
so that d be effectively confined by the core launcher but i do n t know if that s a
bzr changes are pretty hard to follow i think we re determining how it could work so if you think
we have more of an ideas document https docs google com document d edit heading h sta78u24yxr7 hey where can
but you cant just run it withouth the ubuntu core launcher environment use systemctl and syslog thanks i ll read
not sure thats worth it right 1
right i m not sure i should be just using the ppa most of the people we care about are
right but they are all using the ppa right i kind of like snappy 0
and i guess all the uefi confusion was because we never migrated to the beta ppa hmm 0
yup they all use the ppa no i do n t 0
i ca n t quite remember which image it was i used back then do you know wha the eta
it seems doko foundations does n t have the time to fix the ppc builds atm so i believe we
great so is that ubuntu release or ubuntu devel sorry which tutorial 0
ubuntu release should work and for python kind of the idea we had is that we d have a devpack
why would n t it be dirty foo patch patch0 patch1 patch2 dirty bar patch patch3 would you mind looking
if the first 3 patches are from the same file where really we should probably have dirty foo patches patch0
three patches ca n t be from the same file but the hunks could be why would n t it
would you mind looking at py well that does appear to be the case 0
in which branch we should test the various cases 0
in our parsing that will appear as a dirty line on the patch that follows it hmm second patch in
http pastebin ubuntu com 11840023 i ve written two tests using elmo s diff not sure i should commit them
well all but the first that first dirty header has always been in the sample data but presumably it is
bzrlib parses git patches justfine what s wrong with it 1
in what case would the second and third patches not have dirty headers or a blankline not certain 0
i do n t know if we d generate them like that though git might but there s no reason
sure we are parsing them like that now it just did n t seem to align with reality i ve
in which branch parsing them like what 1
not certain if bzrlib patches can parse a combined diff actually i suppose i should test that i mean we
if the first 3 patches are from the same file just wanted to ascertain if there were circumstances where we
anyhow i m parsing elmo s big diff and it seems to be fine now a directory was added which
tested that many times great small bzrlib fix 1
would you mind looking at py our comment count includes the blanklines before dirty headers which bzrlib throws away 1
but if bzrlib throws them away then how can we know if they were there yes 0
then perhaps we should not count them when generating the comment dict we consistently render a blankline before a dirty
so you just assume there s always a blank line between patches yep okay i ll have a look 0
where is a tuple of things we care about i ve written two tests using elmo s diff not sure
yeah no point having such a huge diff of proprietary code no less well we did n t have test
hmm in the context of this iterator not certain how i can determine if the blank is followed by a
so we ca n t assume there s a blank line there well all but the first 0
and we probably should n t insert one into git patches either attributeerror nonetype object has no attribute lower 0
then perhaps we should not count them when generating the comment dict just wanted to ascertain if there were circumstances
anyhow i m parsing elmo s big diff and it seems to be fine now we also have no test
i think it will have to be special cased for git anyway junk is anything preceding 0
one problem possibly not the only problem is the the semantics of dirty headers are still weird i could have
if the first 3 patches are from the same file hunk headers differ 1
in what way the only difference i know of is that the and lines do n t carry timestamps yes
does the way we use pygit2 actually give those to us it would be pretty hostile for it to just
how would feel about some code then which checks for the presence of a blank line preceding a hunk header
if line startswith or not line strip should do it or clause is new i ve written two tests using
where is a tuple of things we care about that wo n t work 1
it will for example consider any blank line within a hunk to be part of the next dirty head well
in what case would the second and third patches not have dirty headers or a blankline and also index 1
that feels like a bug that i should chase down while you work on stacking you mean 9 5 right
well unless you feel like it is a kernel issue http people canonical com ubuntu security cve pkg netty html
the meeting agenda can be found at feel free specifically i am just looking at whether it is related to
ok only do as much on it as determining if it is the same bug as the signal issue o
if not punt it to me hey 0
have n t seen him yet i m happy to do the discussion and vote today we just need one
possibly topic announcements 0
you re up infinity laney micahg xnox bdmurray stgraber dmb ping 1
were you guys having problems with it brb 0
welcome yup mentioned that earlier about the double patches but we got that from debian 1
i added you to dev so yeah update the ppa info the current one 0
agreed yes because they are taking the time to try and help the project be a little bit better at
but do n t you think the reason why team members are n t doing it in the first place
you can even make that bold and uncolor it so it pops out more it is n t like people
fine you act like you re saying patches welcome but everything else you say seems to be well formatted patches
how do you come to that conclusion you re understanding it wrong really 0
http pad ubuntu com xubuntu install slides we re definitely interested 1
i have to repeat then so it makes no sense to try to do something because we wont have any
you ochosi decided with gridcube at the time that perhaps because of his strong dislike for gmb his bias may
im just talking about a guide that welcomes new users and gives fancy and graphical indications of how to do
because nobody proposed that when the discussion was open only once we had started voting on the options brought up
perhaps the way to approach this is for gridcube and me to go and make a working slideshow then go
and really please stop this gmb is not usable nonsense i m trying to have a reasonable conversation with you
what should the team do then to make it feel like we re listening if we leave out work with
actually there is now a debian maintainer so all you need is to ask gnome devs enough times for a
for what gridcube is talking about yep 1
that s my position it s probably going to be just fine which is why i m against that 0
even without an alternative if you think it s a viable candidate 0
i m not using anything that can be counted as an alternative regularly sure let s have the discussion here
i said that in the meeting already but it could even be a set of thunar custom actions as far
i did n t get that oh my 0
good point thats why i keep saying that it makes no sense for me to propose anything because who will
ah well that s what i ve read from others i ve not used it long enough to find out
which is why i m against that unit193 some people argue that there is no way we could n t
and somebody to set that up welcome 1
exactly and thats again why i dropped the case in the first place i m fine with dropping gmb too
no there is still ff tb at least if you want that is 0
yeah i agree was being positive 0
midori what s the plan b if it s not possible to include it in the next lts because of
they do that with pretty much everything anyway we have a lot more slides to cover in the slideshow too
also agreed the other actionable item could be to add a slide about usc back to the installer slideshow then
or maybe the strategy is to mock it until the xpl bursts into tears cracks and promises to install every
yeah i agree again with the flaming 1
also easier to follow the big picture just trying to say there s another side of it 1
sure but the one i have installed is n t an option as it is n t in the repos
i gotted a mention already did you think i installed into usr local d 1
thank you mr grammar police i gotted a mention 0
yeah i dont think the table is completely correct also that s only a starting point yw 1
yes contrary to another platform which would also need a setup and duplicated the package upload like management well package
http pad ubuntu com xubuntu install slides in your opinion 1
ah well that s what i ve read from others i ve not used it long enough to find out
got to make that disclaimer so people wo n t think it s an official statement for the project things
well it s written in docbook but it s shipped as html yeah good idea 1
im not talking about documentation though im talking about something more visible for example a simple slideshow html5 file linked
i m sorry if i offended by anything that s obviously not the goal furthermore as i see it there
that s part of the documentation how do you get a slideshow if thats not how you do an slideshow
the whole chapter really http docs xubuntu org 1410 managing applications html i mean we trowing names around 0
we are welcoming contributions for documentation too and of course trying to make the documentation more visible 1
my opinion is thats just a wall of text that 94 325 of the people will not bother to read
ah please do n t understand this as a snarky comment as it really is n t it s the
i kind of think the same then i realize i very rarely even open gimp yes 1
mmhm i like knome s idea no i just understand how documentaion usually works in any project around the whole
i think that gridcube is talking about more detail than the slideshow itself gives brb 0
maybe but he also wanted a shiny thing that s very short and easily accessible which i think is equal
so do i interpret you right that you d want to see more screenshots on the documentation yeah let s
how do you get a slideshow if thats not how you do an slideshow still no snarky sound still serious
do n t think so that s my understanding 1
what should the team do then to make it feel like we re listening if we leave out work with
but that s hardly our fault i ca n t do it i dont have the technicall abilities to do
so to be interested in hearing you think that several team members should help the person who wants change to
i would guess that nobody would follow the slideshow if it was like that though which is unproductive because that
i wouldn t i thought there was a way to have multiple pads linked 0
also agreed sure i just wanted to point that out to say that even if i think well written manuals
it s your project i m just giving you my time and thoughts we have a lot more slides to
you forgot installing software i added you to dev so yeah update the ppa info 0
we ve come to the conclusion that 7 8 is the right amount gookies d 0
i really think the install slideshow is the wrong place so you are passing on flaming comments from others without
then let s make sure that is involved with plan a but if you do n t like docs and
im not talking about adding screenshots to documentation sounds like a good idea to me 1
and the tour in the docs is always accessible after installation too gridcube as well as all the things related
because nobody proposed that when the discussion was open only once we had started voting on the options brought up
is it whoa i need to redact that sentence let me try again 0
and do you have the knowledge to do some of this it s called paraphrasing 0
but once set up a change in ucs in docs how to make sure change to new thing happens absolutely
the same as everything in the docs we make sure it s up to date mails sound razonable to me
no neither am i but trying has to be worth it and i could try with you 1
i dont know the question is not only to set up the slideshow it s about setting the packaging and
yes ack so just about management 1
yes contrary to another platform which would also need a setup and duplicated the package upload like management agreed 0
you re understanding it wrong really sure whynot get rid of gimp and ristretto and leave gthumb then 0
i m sure that we d get help when we ve got a working model why not work on that
i gotted a mention sure 1
we can help you convert your content into docbook i m not happy about people being frustrated then again i
is docbook how slideshow is written i appreciated your effort but maybe you dropped the ball a bit too early
no the slideshow again is pure html because the default media player choice change should n t be about gmb
is docbook how slideshow is written what do n t you understand 1
again with the flaming gridcube is envisaging a slideshow for this stuff eg html 1
neither am i at this point yep 0
already had some random whites not sayiing anything 0
yea i know what you mean but if people like you and i do n t do the things that
redundancy means more things to maintain eg more time to be used to maintain the stuff not create new just
which is why i m asking could a more graphical chapter in the documentation do the same thing plan b
and that s not why i think that perhaps yes either way quotes likely would have helped you 0
and before you go too deep in anything have a quick chat with slickymaster and the technical people on the
half way house between the basics and the docs we change the reality of the world or we add a
that i believe that it is 0
i really think that the best way forward is for us to get a working idea together one thing though
in your opinion ok cool 1
like slideshow sort of thing just 1
we can do the communicating anyway you want makes no difference to me i assume you are meaning something like
it s your project i m just giving you my time and thoughts im not talking about adding screenshots to
copy paste for the win ok wfm 0
hi i ll try to stay focus d they others discussed it as well and then joined 0
that s good i m not personaly an expert but my other french colleagues would certainly also help when support
personaly i think that it s a good idea just discuss the issue with him i thought it should be
that s an issue to discuss with members or on board before ty so much d 0
no way but just speaking about global subcription to a new loco like ubuntu africa i m standing in a
that perspective can be discussed during the meeting so ive tried joining the teams and have been successful with some
so i went through the list and just joined all over you are doing well the consequences will be catastrophic
ah d haha 0
is that just stupid the bootscript will give a lot of info we would have to ask in general in
awesome btw is it better to select install alongside windows or something else and create the partitions myself in the
depends what you want hey there is anyone here 0
personal choice really i do gthe manual always upgrade dusti n 0
ok standby ask the channel to help on that if needed or maybe a why it may not be needed
yeah seems unlikely dual boot sounds like the best and next would be a vm i am only a bot
i am only a bot please do n t think i m intelligent i was following the directions out of
there are as many opinions as there are possibilities choose what works for you it is the time in seconds
do you have two hd s perchance nothing relevant to wlan or rfkill in bios that i can see what
yes but only one fits inside the laptop new batter 0
was i supposed to type du home booting what through the usb an install or live 1
its using mir and best is to ask in ubuntu touch if i simply took out the windows hdd and
i do n t think windows will take to kindly to that i think i ve got it for the
k 1 sec lem me try i was doing ctrl alt f1 and it didnt work right i would use
i ve been using it in arch bubbasaures but gon na install ubuntu that s why i was asking so
on the first gui of something else boot should be in the hd should be sda no partitions ok looks
can someone tell me command to get me to console with gui or x running i had wondered if this
are there not important great uefi help here you might be sure where our at is correct and you ve
you ve seen the uefi wiki you just seem lost in general is all heya what s the best way
i do n t know how it suddenly got missing in just under a few days the ubuntu install should
i think i ve got it for the moment i ll wait until i m actually installing or have installed
ok i ve disabled both path to windows mount 0
yes but your confirmation might help speed up the dev s then you should be good to go are you
yeah ubuntu 15 10 0
the thing is rather complicated for me so sounds like you re on the right path thnen 1
aloha e komo mai welcome cool 0
does anyone know how to set it to look in univers binary amd64 packages join freenode if you canoot fix
information about the ubuntu touch platform for phone and tablet is available here https wiki ubuntu com touch support and
i thought i had to remove grub too to uninstall ubuntu sadly an hp proboook 450 it was free lol
let me see what i can find hold up ok you said you re using 11 10 or 11 04
unity gnome shell kde xfce lxde or what it s realtek is it possibly blocked check with rfkill list all
veebull shoot i ll give it a go not too much vagrant experience though it s not showing anything but
it s so strange i know it has bluetooth because i had multiple devices connected when it was windows i
meaning the hardware is definitely present i ll brb i m going to go do some lung therapy bashing om
cause adduser is sort of complainy is yours a 450 g0 g1 or g2 1
for what driver and is wifi working properly 1
your home has 25gb you can backup whatever you need g1 1
ff has it off due to a 0 day i have used that directory sometimes you must throw the content
might be hardware failure if both os dont see it https wiki ubuntu com securityteam knowledgebase firefoxandadobeflashnpapi 1
qualcomm atheros qca9565 ar9565 wireless network adapter rev 01 i cant find a usb disk creator or anything like that
mmm good job then yeah bluetooth should be showing under rfkill list all 1
so why is ubuntu ignoring it time to try it i suppose 0
reboot oh i have been there and done that i am not that much of a fiddler my use is
ok well you can use sudo useradd m user are you using wifi on this laptop 1
i think i forgot something how incredibly stupid i am 1
is there any screenshot sharing app for ubuntu try logging out with ctrl alt del and then logging back in
is it different from wine thank you for your time and your help have a good day or night depending
i mean have you tried a reboot because sprunge is a website 1
so what should i get to use sprunge tks 0
command curl f sprunge http sprunge us its not showing anything but the wireless lan 0
i find piping output to termbin com to be easier command nc termbin com 9999 you would have to click
there is also the pastebinit package tarelerulz or just get a new usb to verify your ubuntu iso image or
yeah just edit bashrc and create an alias then sddm is kubuntu are you on kubuntu 0
agreed if you re running ubuntu base you can have several window managers and switch between pretty painlessly vinagre joins
ubottu something else yes 1
i mean i ve never done it myself and unity can be sort of finicky about what it runs alongside
indeed could have been me my hardware my love of non free video drivers just sayin pleasure 0

note that uboot env only includes foo bar so the boot will stop at the uboot prompt indeed nice 0
we do n t have a distinguishing factor between the ubuntu s i also updated the branch to depend on
care to take a look at that tomorrow rsalveti sheck for system image 1
ok let me try to make a simple one i m not sure what we want to verify here right
i had it working before but now cant get it to work anymore yeah etc os release might be the
that s a bug then care to take a look at that tomorrow 1
elopio it looks like ubuntu snappy cli is not installed on tarmac snapcraft tests need it yes try now merged
pushed thanks for the review trying arch fixes again 0
sergiusens fan is a mix of a few things right text conflict with trunk 1
any idea about that ready 1
need dpkg dev installed nice approved 1
if elf does n t work you ask help from a dwarf do we want plainbox tests for all the
snapcraft plugins python2 py well i suppose so but usually a test gets put in examples because it needs big
hmm do you know how to tell plainbox to run only one category 1
in runtests sh you can see how we do it for normal plainbox run t 2015 com canonical snapcraft normal
when trying to build the py2 example i get http paste ubuntu com 12003190 uh 0
when trying to build the py2 example i get http paste ubuntu com 12003190 but it should be provided by
snapcraft plugins python2 py cool works now 0
yes i see it in ubuntuoptions but does it get python dev from the archive and install it somewhere sergiusens
yes try now merged from trunk and updated to use snappy metadata instead of old method k 0
can you snapcraft run that one i get http paste ubuntu com 12003271 no wily is broken i said you

try fregl he s one of the project product managers on the quick side afair in that case we can
do you know when 5 6 is going to be released even when if close gedit i m left with
actually my question is are we in a hurry with that fix should i ping someone in irc to review
yeah loading xcursors is just regular file io stuff thread at will the beta is out now ish 1
try fregl he s one of the project product managers on the quick side afair that s what i was
pong ping 0
yeah i was also thinking whether to have it in a separate mp the xcursor thing we use is not
no it s not it does use a library to load xcursors but its source code is in the plugin
good it s self contained 1
should we land that test now with the expectfail or wait until qt is fixed so it s not a
yeah loading xcursors is just regular file io stuff thread at will ah is that the currentindex on horizontal listview
hi all have to mind qquickimageprovider api though 1
that s what i was wondering if it made sense to convert that qquickimageprovider to the async version i get
cursors are so small later feature not that high in my priority list 0
ping and they re loaded on demand 1
although animated cursors comprise a good number of separate images in that case we can commit it now 0
all packaged in a single file though back 0
i said yeah probably not worth increasing the complexity then until we actually find out it s a bottleneck do
all packaged in a single file though that s what you missed 0
qplatformcursorimage but we have no support for animated cursos yet although that xcursor lib might still load all frame into
i d quite happily accept your mouse cursor work leaving app custom animated cursors for a later mp once qt
yeah i was also thinking whether to have it in a separate mp pong 0
btw what you mentioned about custom bitmap cursors does n t the qplatformcursor already have a helper class to deal
er qplatformcursorimage 1
the sole purpose of this class is to provide qt s fallback built in cursors we are targeting to put

they should be stopped cheers waigani if this works out i ll owe you a beer or 2 0

not sure why perhaps an additional sync or sleep 5 or so works there this needs checking for some running
i suppose the second mount for ro fails then oh strange 0
yeah those do n t have any additional test deps not sure why perhaps an additional sync or sleep 5
i tried adding this directly to the list of dependencies in the manifest but it did n t make a
yes the sync solves the busy issue but it is still unable to install the upgrade as you know http
yeah those do n t have any additional test deps yeah i figure that s the issue that elopio brought
it seems that when i run tests for a click not all the required dependencies are getting installed probably better
right thanks for clarification i replied to elopio s email too for sanity tests the image must not be modified
i was looking at some other click manifests but ca n t see any references to the autopilot dependencies in
hey i seem to have a problem with adt run ok now trying sync after apt get update and before
it seems that when i run tests for a click not all the required dependencies are getting installed like different
unfortunately i am seeing another problem similar to the one i saw with imagemagick previously http pastebin ubuntu com 10091944
you might just as well open a bug with the log as we have a bug somewhere where does the
i think we might take some time to refactor it in the next sprint if you think it s worthwhile
i suppose the second mount for ro fails then will do thanks 1
indeed no python3 wand installed i get importerror no module named wand 0
i suppose the reason is that there is no camera app autopilot test dependency am i looking in the right
dobey there is no need to pass v to autopilot tests that s the default now it also produces a
note that you can now use override control path to fixed manifest if you want to do a test run
oh thanks let me give that a try so bug report with d debug output appreciated i ll look into
yeah those do n t have any additional test deps how can this be fixed on the britney host 0
indeed no python3 wand installed you can just add a depends field like in https people debian org mpitt autopkgtest
i think we might take some time to refactor it in the next sprint if you think it s worthwhile
unfortunately i am seeing another problem similar to the one i saw with imagemagick previously http pastebin ubuntu com 10091944
oh strange ah that looks like something in the test clobbers but a bit hard to say just from that
so that one does setup commands mount o remount rw apt get update mount o remount ro so bug report
not yet i was looking at the bq phones yes i ll put all the details into a bug thank
normally i m not a fan of refactoring code for the sake of it but i think we might start
like different tests doing different things in the setup compared to the test itself hey i seem to have a
i just ran adt run directly without the apt get update lots of duplicated code actually 1
sounds ok are you talking about the self tests or the autopilot tests good morning 0
no the selftests are fine i removed all the state files now and re ran the tests hope that helps
yeah i can raise a bug for each issue the sanity tests i e the main purpose of the project
not sure why perhaps an additional sync or sleep 5 or so works there this needs checking for some running
i have autopkgtest 3 9 4 ok how would you like to do it report a bug for each issue
there should be a class derived from basetestcase to do those steps in the setup you ve already got one

knome thoughts http i imgur com kafssnb png we ca n t get involved personally in all sub communities as
no just talked to a tails person before really weird that there are those totally disconnected communities 0
http pad ubuntu com xubuntu derivative guidelines can you check if the package list makes sense at all i did

or drop it i had the public link which for me was basically useless 1
it s the same link you just have to have edit rights i did n t know there was a
i just checked what my link said it s basically the calendar id not going to make the meeting 0
i had extra and without answering inline in emails p 1
or in docker for people like me 1
if i do that the device stops being listed as a bootable one to know when something must be ready
so that my app continues to work configfile prefix grub cfg 0
and i think for everyone in the dev community it depends on a product if i wanted to build a
the prob here is that all our implementations are still rather theoretic while they are there we dont have much
oh no as any time you remove stuff from the image 1
that inspiron does n t list non uefi or non secure devices you break compatiblity 1
you can drop that env variable afaik that s unrealistic go rewrite my software for me 1
sure that s just reality snappy 0
bug 1467474 in snappy hardware yaml should allow including changelog kernel config and license files undecided new https launchpad net
ok so if it s booting the signed grub efi binary one notable difference is that it will not load
just bring your own distro with html 0
since again a snap needs to be self contained well regardless of what you think about what is in the
deb2snap 30 50 packages if the core grants you nothing 1
also what seed are you building from i guess this is n t in ubuntu wily yet then it s
it s not a thing at all thanks 0
as the cert should work beyond 15 04 great who wants that 1
do we have a handy guide for putting a snappy image on an sd card to play with on a
but i m happy to try and let you know that is why your snap should include everything it needs
imo we should have started with the empty room and added stuff we started with a room with some things
be serious microsoft and apple learned the hard way that s not the way to do it 1
http paste ubuntu com 11757694 ha but you ask everyone to replace theirs 1
i see what you do hey sergiusens 0
but it s hard to work in this world so that i can fit everything in the case i ve
i d love to have a roadmap for that the problem is in wording 1
show me a link on ubuntu com that lists what the core provides that inspiron does n t list non
right that was a previous issue that got resolved by the 10g size bump and a big warning that says
it seems that i need to package things like wpa supplicant and all the ip tools and that insert name
works nice be serious 1
it depends on a product if i wanted to build a stb device on top of snappy i d have
you around to help me with some uefi snappy personal boot issues on ubuntu com in html 1
with explanation grr 0
nobody understands snappy because of failure of communication and it mangles the executable names preload and library paths for you
of what snappy is and isnt good morning 0
like back then i first tried to boot a x86 iso and it never listed the device as bootable and
if it breaks the creator of that something else made a mistake and all those issues just contribute to the
no we re all people nobody cares if to make something great you need to make it great for developers
i m really talking about the snappy api i assume the store does n t have a way to tell
i had extra is this written down anywhere any design doc a white paper anything that i can read apart
do n t mistake resistance i supposed that s possible if you look at sda3 and sda4 do you have
if the core grants you nothing with walking blindfolded over a minefield 1
i m forced to deliver somthing onto a platform i do n t fully understand that is changing that has
secure or not it seems to me that the best way to do what i want is to just ship
well one reason for me working on py snapper or node snapper or ted and mike working on snapcraft is
snappy and one that has a large app to port 1
neither py snapper nor anything like that will help me as my app is just more complex than that and
in docker no to challenge the current implementation by trying to implement it with whats there 0
you break compatiblity deb2snap 30 50 packages 1
into one huge snap if that s possible by deb2snap grep if post up down 0
with explanation then path everything to understand new executable names 1
there is a webcam example that might give some insight zyga 15 04 will not break rolling on the other
by including everything you need for execution inside your snap btw putting files into system boot uboot does indeed not
if you are going to put it in system boot uboot maybe just target the file to no where and
you wont ever be able to get anything in the store that relies on dpkg at least that all looks
would be my way bug 1467474 1
is shipped hardware enablement is something that goes into core indeed can you tell me how this is all supposed
is shipped hardware enablement is something that goes into core indeed ah so what kind of hardware enablement for wifi
or networking in general what kind of ip tools do we plan on supporting you dump your wlan config into
ok that s good to know ok ls prefix 0
can you tell me how this is all supposed to work according to you as the cert should work beyond
e g at which level do apps come in but even if it will not break it is wrong to
ok ls prefix and at which level should we test 1
the oem snap ships kernel image modules and support bits correct can it also ship commands scripts lets skip our
sorry i was afaik yeah unsure about why sergiusens used ame in his command was the hack name in mvo
is secureboot enabled on it how do i tell note please separate current limitations 1
hi from the design 1
i havent played personally with our hardware access story i know some bits of that landed though and enable you
at least without major changes it surely is it is the fundamental design principle of snappy 0
hmm wait new snap i though minimal system has three snaps os oem gadget hey sergiusens 0
d we resolved that one since the pastbin was done 0
ok so snappy config yaml is how apps can reconfigure network i did n t know about that part 0
to etc network interfaces it depends on a product if i wanted to build a stb device on top of
hey sergiusens though perhaps in a private framework for network that my app could talk to 1
that s unrealistic go rewrite my software for me for certification i m trying to see what s the low
and verify through the programme sorry nautilus fat fail 0
success when we say wifi on product works what did we test 1
and what did we specifically left out so i guess this error is also reproducible when booting under bios 0
one of the things the snapp scope will eventually need to do is actually launch snaps in the past i
so what would be your advice to wait and not create the programme i do n t think it s
i want to solder angled headers for serial or to specify something and just go with it for 15 04
webcams are going to be under generic usb host capability along with lots of other products alright thank you 0
it s not a thing at all ok if that s what you say then this is important feedback so
aha as in come up with requirements and start writing tests right now 1
now 1 grep if post up down 0
who s working on the hardware design side of snap interfaces d but yeah 0
the oem snap ships kernel image modules and support bits correct can it also ship commands scripts any luck with
that inspiron does n t list non uefi or non secure devices i ve just had a successful build a
hum no i m shocked will need to sit down for a bit 1
as you want i doubt it makes a difference chipaca hi 1
barry chipaca now i get a problem from golang go http paste ubuntu com 11757173 hey tedg 0
not sure probably to set the ap data we couldnt start with the empty room simply because we use legacy
e g on http paste ubuntu com 11719625 the lines 17 to 26 interfaces 1
thats still from before we added to the image though so it has some ill instructions about making the image
but that stuff relies on wireless tools i m on image 3 i see there s there there s no
and without it the hooks wo n t do anything i ve just sent you a catch up email one
dpkg l wireless tools it failes to boot on the inspiron 0
grep if post up down not sure probably to set the ap data 0
nothing like personalized searches i was googling for beaglebone wifi but that stuff relies on wireless tools 0
works nice echo prefix 0
is that correct thanks 1
mad fool you also what seed are you building from i guess this is n t in ubuntu wily yet
what for aourl you need iwconfig why it s so cute when it fits in the case 1
oooooh so technically hardware enablement should happen inside the core image itself via the owm snap wifi configuration should happen
for both wily and vivid pong 1
haha okay ok ls prefix 0

i m really talking about the snappy api i assume the store does n t have a way to tell
we resolved that one since the pastbin was done when there is a complete story for it i guess it
alright i was n t sure if that would somehow fit into the type field or what whats up with
well that s a question for the elders of the internet aka snappy architects ls efi 0
i do n t see tvoss here so maybe olli knows who s dealing with this brb trying on my

really that s interesting well i do n t know maybe it s not properly set up p 1
hi that image has grub efi amd64 signed installed 1
there were discussions about moving away from e n i to systemd s network manager tool ok so if it
hd0 gpt2 filesystem is fat if you get a different error you know secureboot is enabled 1
if i do that the device stops being listed as a bootable one ls efi 0
so it should n t make a difference ok ls prefix 1
aha 1
what s the precise version of ubuntu device flash you used for creating this image and what commandline did you
i tried with the hack from http paste ubuntu com 11700710 but let me try again with trunk proper support
how can i tell if there is anything funny get debug info ok but i should wait for you to
as you want i doubt it makes a difference if we as a company failed to communicate this clearly 0
webcams are going to be under generic usb host capability along with lots of other products well one thing i

that was the idea p i m already using it on desktop for studying and this way it looks familiar

hey mirv same question 0
i want to make colemak and get it into ubuntu phone popey said to go bother you incessantly until you
heh is there a good api for doing this are you using the old templates from linux to generate keyboard
ah okay it s a bit of a tricky one at the moment basically the current system uses qml layouts
is there a preprocessor flag for recognizing if app is running on ubuntu touch or desktop pc which also opens
best option is to do what ubuntu does and provide it by default imho hey 0
however i m not sure when we re likely to land those changes as they re part of a big
no worries anyway so this is n t done through click packages 1
is there a preprocessor flag for recognizing if app is running on ubuntu touch or desktop pc not currently at
ah okay 3 0
but we want to move away from that in the future as it s not great for space usage as
as each layout also then has the relevant dictionaries prediction data etc for its language jmulholland hi this follows up
so we ll be shifting to having layouts available via click instead hmmmm interesting 0
hey but i m not sure what the timeframe for that is likely to be as most of my time
is it just one deb with all the layouts or one deb per layout 3 0
any icon designers here after a recent post and templates i tried my hand at it and here s the
but we want to move away from that in the future as it s not great for space usage as
if you wanted something immediate you could create a branch that has colemak debs but i ca n t guarantee
yeah they are a pain funny enough i made a qml layout before though pong 0
plugins en in the ubuntu keyboard source i like it 0
is there a preprocessor flag for recognizing if app is running on ubuntu touch or desktop pc http bazaar launchpad
the header caption has been moved into the title bar and the zoom selector into the default head state well
heh no worries 1
where do you get that number from is it an editor i am an old vi fan 0
no that doesnt make sense you ve verified the image correct just covering bases 0
i only found a 2 6 kernel with that number oh you mean our new project talk to daftykins in
i think it was ensuring the pastebinit package is installed in the chroot so you are running ubuntu 14 04
wow you re such a great helper you deserve a cookie yes a huge list and fstab and fstab d
paste curlyears so when booting without the usbs can you choose a older kernel in the grub booting menu and
yes it was reported of using 16 04 from etc issue too bad you ca n t ask for ssh
probably i just need to know how to backup my files toa usb thuhmb or a cd from what i
agreed i was just confirming the info yep now that boot is populated grub should work properly 0
ok while i wait for tj hhow do i install a new hd so ubuntu 14 04 lts sees it
so let s get clear what the situation is you have at least 2 pcs a good one you re
ok so we can use a chroot environment to fix it it seems to be so broken as to be
does the pc have uefi firmware yep 0
yeah i m writing it and putting a site up for it i do n t ghonestly know what is
any packages installed via ppa do dmesg grep efi get any results 1
uefi is the sucessor to bios firmware and it affects the mode the pc boots in and what boot loader
that s fine so now lets find out if the live iso booted in efi mode do ls sys firmware
every so often a box opens on my desktop infomring my that my software is out of date and n

k1 it is part of the rlease from canonical anyhow now we know where things are lets get on with
oh i see hjttp pastebinubuntu do sudo mkdir target mount dev mapper ubuntu vg root target 1
k1 me neither tj had me do it no stop i mistyped again wait a mo 1
thank you guys i ca n t seem to locate either efnet or freennode networks m which both host ubuntu
hmmm you ve already been doing some work on this then no i have one system currently booted in live
pastebinit mount genii great 0
curlyears lsblk parted http paste ubuntu com 14128364 yeh start a pastebin shell all output goes to it 1
oh you mean our new project talk to daftykins in discuss we have a surprise waiting there do you happen
ah good if someone is doing that ok now let s create a chroot environment for n in proc sys
yeah i m writing it and putting a site up for it no british 0
ok that s what we d expect inside the chroot but it could also be outside it what does mount
so when booting without the usbs can you choose a older kernel in the grub booting menu and try that
up usr sbin grub mkconfig 250 usr sbin grub mkconfig can not create boot grub grub cfg new directory nonexistent
that s during system install net installer you ve verified the image correct just covering bases 0
perhaps it can also end the tyranny of people doing teleconference demonstrations of shell stuff where you end up with
sorry had to go do some things back now then apt get install linux generic 0
e opening configuration file 5 ifstream ifstream 2 no such file or directory when i try to instrall pastebinit that
ok now install the pastebinit package in case it is n t already installed apt get install pastebinit now pastebinit
nope i am doing fresh system install you can use your tab key for autocompletion of nicknames in irc as
good idea ok efi doesnt related to hdds 0
you do get some broken packages during development so it s not unusual oops sowwy for the caps 0
nginx ok here hmmm you ve already been doing some work on this then 0
your usb device is apparently unpartitioned for posting multi line texts into the channel please use http paste ubuntu com
prompt it root ubuntu most times that should be done automatic by your filebrowser like nautlius if nautilus doesnt do
tab complete wait when i cd into target and do a pwd it says i am in ubuntu ubuntu target
see dmesg after you put the usb in hmm pastebinit really needs to be more automatic for this type of
mounting by uuid has been since 8 04 0
well however long it s been i do n t know howto use the uuid approach ls al 0
your usb device is apparently unpartitioned yeah then somehow magically the kernels dissapeared 0
from what i can tell you had them mount proc sys dev dev pts to target instead of somewhere in
we cant know such details if you dont tell them where do you get that number from 0
i m trying to be 100 certain you re executing the command including the pastebinit part so please pastebin a
always keep in mind that its support though a cable we dont see or know what you do can i
i believe the original point of the exercise was to get grub installed properly onto the drive which was not
if the tool exists do wget o target etc apt sources list http iam tj projects ubuntu trusty sources list
http paste ubuntu com 14129257 i think it was ensuring the pastebinit package is installed in the chroot 1
ok lets gather some info then pastebinit cat etc fstab mount ls latr boot bring me the barrel 0
then you should be able to shutdown from the livecd and boot normally to hdd from what i can tell
ok you re not in the chroot so sudo chroot target then which pastebinit if that command does n t
well my normal filesystem is present onm the target warning setting to a non zero value when is set is
right we unmounted that and mounted the file system at target 1
ok please do cat etc issue and tell us in here what it reports if you do ping c5 8
then we bind mounted the virtual file systems under target and chroot ed in i m back 0
do you happen to be lithuanian alternately the chroot resolv conf may not know anything 1
quite a few years possibly yes but earlier we did 2 ping tests with both ip and hostnames and both
pastebinit ls latr target etc apt well my normal filesystem is present onm the target 0
and now pastebinit ls latr target etc apt sources list d doggone it 0
ahhh now it s working on your 1
ok i ve created a default apt sources list here you can directly download it to that system first check
is my system ready to reboot into normal mode if the tool exists do wget o target etc apt sources
ok take a look at this it shows how at the shell prompt i issue the entire command i see
i m going to dinner now doggonwe it i was afraid of that i deleted the wrong frickin line form
the line which mounts dev mapper ubuntu vg home to needs to be commented out you mist have typed unmatched
do you know i ve been in here about 5 hours so far today you guys are great type another
the package name is pastebinit irc window to the terminal window and then pasted 0
so it s likely it still wo n t boot use tab to highlight users 1
are you really a person i have no idea what the user was doing previously but it was going backwards
i m at work so always going back and forth fromt he computer so please pastebin a sudo parted l
where would the usb thumb appear in dev what sort of job do you have 1
and give us the link it helps if you re ask your issue once in a while all in one
so more than 5 6 years superintendent of an old office building 1
if i had 250 i could buy another 2 3tb drives and be in storafge heaven so at this point
thats why then if you do ping c5 8 8 8 8 do you get a result that it is
it is a trusty install based on the etc issue type the command exactly as i gave it inside the
apt get install pastebin you installed xenial yes 1
the issue came to this channel due to some earlier confusion but kept here to avoid confusion in ubuntu ah
i do n t think so this is n t a ubuntu 16 versiopn it s 14 04 hiyas all
penquin42 when i have tried to edit fstab the os tells me that is n t permitted even when doingh
that s all it s doing what does pwd report 1
ok that s what we d expect inside the chroot but it could also be outside it what does mount
this is freenode these are the support channels so what does ls l etc fstab show you 1
s to the to be line 10 of that fstab is going to break things please do umount dev mapper
you have that mounting over the root file system no wonder we could n t see any files in etc
next after that umount command you should be able to do ls l etc apt and see something more 1
it seems to be so broken as to be next to impossible to fix every time we try something straigntforward
if you run update grub what does it do ah ok 0
i have a segmentation fault now was working fine last week currently i would exit the chroot with exit then
for comparison this was the fstab you posted earlier http paste ubuntu com 14132426 i either need to rec over
yeh very messy did you make the correct change to target etc fstab first 1
then do pastebinit target etc apt sources list sources list d cd sudo chroot target 1
did you miss out the semi colon before that so now you are chrooted into target 1
so at this point do you get a list of files when you do ls etc should populate it 0
sigh if i could just get my second hdd mounted or my usb thumb to work all of this could
the package name is pastebinit when you ran update grub did it find kernels to boot 1
for comparison this was the fstab you posted earlier http paste ubuntu com 14132426 not sure i do n t
please pastebin a mount and a sudo parted l umountumount dev mapper ubuntu vg home not found 0
theoretically yes but lets just get the facts collected yeh very messy 0
did you do the grub install dev sda before running the update grub cat etc issue 1
hang on blueskaj now pastebinit etc apt sources list 1
it s the linux lts utopic branches latest being ubuntu lts 3 16 0 57 04 1 cd etc apt
hmmm i do n t know what went wrong check for typos 1
still with us then pastebin it 0
so let s get clear what the situation is you have at least 2 pcs a good one you re
did you manage to wget the sources list file into etc apt directory yet ok so the live has booted
thats because we need to get a valid sources list file into your etc apt directory 0
ok would be actually helping a lot if you stop doing other things or doing things different then we ask
does the pc have uefi firmware just to confirm do pastebinit etc apt sources list 1
that seems to work just to make sure grub is actually installed grub install dev sda and then the update
see you soon if there s an issue boot again to the cd usb and return 1
no one else seemed to understand why i was chroot ed and so i was trying to deal with this
are you in either of france or germany are you really a person 0
np ok 1
if we think that we need to pre wake apps that might soon be on screen then we should apply
o this one next please https code launchpad net dandrader unity8 ddaimprovements merge 254964 0
tx but if it s writable i d expect it to also be able to remove you from that group
s it them hi do you know if the unity application stack will tell me if the dash app is
from that lockscreen if you press that button again you go down the lightdm route so you d want to
then as soon as they do that the scopes become inactive and gps goes off but anyway that s why
k screen gets on on incoming text too even worse to wake scopes up then 1
as it has to do this sort of trickery to get good performance thinking about it more the scopes only
the dash is already sorta special in that it never gets suspended sure 1
i m not against it i m just saying we need to take into account that it s not only
so i still ca n t see any dbus calls from indicator session to lightdm i have debug code in
and previously did n t you ll waste battery this way to fetch results that the user might never see
my bq rtm stops asking for the pincode to unlock previously it did on screen wake up 1
and previously did n t yeah but you have the greeter and maybe the locker 1
yeah it could actually be we have two bugs there yeah and that wasted power 1
sure we need to fix the ux of scope refresh but i had it configured on pin i think and
i m not against it i m just saying we need to take into account that it s not only
do you know where dbus display manager h is located regarding indicator session it seems that it is included and
i marked 018 finally as tested phew maybe i should just do the simple solution and see if anyone complains
i ll comment on both our and upstream 0
it is generated but in the src backend dbus directory to clarify it will only trigger the refresh on focus
bug 1439318 got it thanks 1
thought can you check plasma5 with silo 018 yeah it could actually be we have two bugs there 0
yeah slide to unlock and yes it s in nopasswdlogin not sure why how i guess i can yes the
yes but i had it configured on pin i think and that s what settings is listing as current config
wops good call are you looking for tasks 0
aargh even though good call i should probably cancel the qa signoff process like the usual userdata 0
yeah unsure how i changed it added it to the group guess so trace looks genuine bug in qt and
could be or popey used a different steps to repro k 0
and the scope you have selected uses location no need if the steps to repro are the same 1
ever seen this when trying to compile unity8 http pastebin ubuntu com 10724501 i ve the image as r w
should there not be a bumped dependency between unity8 and system components for laggy backends never mind solved 1
should have clarified that it s important to get the scope queries running early for us 0
so i think with the first time you use that indicator session button lock screen it uses an internal lockscreen
from that lockscreen if you press that button again you go down the lightdm route yeah but what if they
i ll just assume there is a good reason for that and take a look at unity7 code thanks got
yes there were technical reasons why it was hard to use the greeter as a simple session lockscreen at the
i think robert ancell solved most of them but not sure the state of play there sure 0
did you mount stuff as rw like etc group but anyway that s why there s a separate session lockscreen
knock it off dandrader afk people have confirmed the tap indicator issue on rtm where we do n t have
bug 1439318 it s just slide to unlock for you now 1
is your user somehow in the nopasswdlogin group yeah and that wasted power 0
we need to improve the refresh ux that would help with results popping up yeah slide to unlock and yes
resubmitted laggy backend branch that s crazy town 1
i guess i can yes the only thing in there is qtbus right did you mount stuff as rw like
accountsservice does normally try to add the user to the group but normally fails because scope rebuilding is a bit
because that is n t writable i have some debug code in lightdm c inside that prints the gdbusmethodinvocation method
but if it s writable i d expect it to also be able to remove you from that group hi
well i think that situation is n t normal for a customer at least but still not great that we

uefi is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware it is meant as

so your partitons will be sda2 sda3 home i installed 14 04 from sd card technically usb 1
but computer wont work with 1404 so i would have to see how far debian 7 lts goes it worked
right that installs using an entirely different method ubiquity not debian installer yes i installed it via sudo python setup
is there a command installer in that iso or do i need a different iso i did n t see
so redundent you should be able to use vlc to do it but you probably want an actualy video editing

and how would i create home in sda2 along with that s fine i m asking why the os is
i understand there s a problem with the repo and i m going to try to get it fixed but
for instance if that repo gives a list with packages i386 and there has been a change only with i386
there are no i386 packages at all for this product so i do n t see that being a problem
and should i maek multi partitions only with the games that run 0

ok type cd and hit tab so it autocompletes it there is always sleep though 0
usually if there s a space in a file you have to use quotes like cd 32gb usb or escape
put a space after cd then hit tab i mean how can i check 0
how do i do that put the space after cd 1
it think you want to autocomplete the cd command right now try clicking on one and see if it works
ah you have an ubuntu gnome live cd which already has universe enabled it means that port is running oms
if u tellme how to share pictures i will send the screenshot so that u can understand easily if it
other stuff is self explanatory i m saying that if you asking about samsung supplied linux drivers for their chromebook
after i start the installer it stays on the splash screen for a sec or 2 then the screen turns
do custom installation of windows manually define the space to use etc licensing 1

i tried to format sda2 with ext4 by the way why aptitude and synaptic has been removed from ubuntu by
morning try using manual partitioning 1
grep etc apt sources list etc apt sources list d ubuntu can be install in sda2 it has plenty of
rebooting heh what s the size of dev sda2 1
the perm for the var backups group bak are 600 only root can see it make sure you are only
and format it with ext4 windows 7 should if it does n t you can always change it back 0
ok i did that do i select it as mountpoint 1
yes make that the only mountpoint dont make a boot that doesnt mean u have to break driver when it
you can make a home if you like i have an ubuntu 14 04 vm with a cpu i added
it s a software raid which means that you can use the ubuntu partitions without a raid there selecting mountpoint
paste in paste ubuntu com if you want a home you can add that as another mountpoint 1
it will be renamed sdax when u say shell u mean the terminal 0
i ll just get an ssd no it wont be resized just add the mountpoints on sda2 everything is automatics
the installer is warning about missing swap partition ok type sudo service lightdm restart 0
ubuntu installer does not offer the option to resize the partition pretty easy though 0
dont resize the partition gregl sir i cant locate my device through cli can u tell me where it is
you can make an option swap partition of say 1gb i am not sure if its necessary anymore type adb
i ca n t see how i can create home and swap tkae care 0
so ioria do i remove quiet splash you dont have to do it if you want a home partiton add
it does n t gunnar did you do msg or notice 0
the warning does n t say it will create swap well that only took 18 hours including a sleep break
it should n t be warning him about not having swap toshiba toshibalaptop media toshiba 32gb usb md5sum c md5sum
were you in there earlier do0fy3 are you installing ubuntu or just installing more storage drives 0
installer as for root partition is there a way to query whether a package came with the distro or not
it should n t 14 04 0
then select the number row easy peasy you can create a swap file after 1
you could just do manual partitioning should be easy enough it s a pretty recent card 0
how many disks do you have pm newbnewb 0
then it should be easy enough to just partition some space out and set up the partitions grow up 0
is it ok but did you set up the parititons when selecting that 1
i can only select sda2 choose filesystem type and mount point absorb the wisdom 0
what is sda2 desktop 0
have you ran terminal command sudo update grub to pick up new added items empty partition 1
or you can cat proc mounts i might have to boot the iso in a vm to check this should
sda2 is empty it should be ubuntu after i install it there layl yes use a linux life usb that
its just 1 long line of text can you delete sda2 1
no it shows free space etc networkmanager system connections maybe something in here 0
perfect are you doing it all on one partition 0
i just wanted to install and learn how big of a swap partition do you want 1
well i ca n t answer that for you hmm 0
ok swap ca n t be encrypted so no 1
ok how large is the free space oh or not 0
is there anything i can do to confirm this ok so make a new partition on the free space that
the default partitioner puts everything on one this is what i got after the apt cache command 0
swap boot root home yeah e g info example com goes to ducky example com and legs example com 0
ok so a 100mb boot should be fine windows is the main stream hence ms windows 0
it is asks 0
it means that port is running oms service which requires a set of interactions between it and the client in
why is root more tricky thinks 0
make it like 30gb the ubuntu installer did not set up anything i had to manually create the partitions in
it s owned by root root you could do less if you want but that s a pretty safe amount

d aww very nice 1
heh file under security bugs on modern tvs 1
i m on 3 18 ewww 3 19 on utopic has been fine for me so far which games are
not a week for it to be in the limelight according the phoronix http www phoronix com scan php page
yeah so assume vivid will be jumping soon maybe that ll fix it but i have n t noticed any
one you need is that a port to 1 3 step it s simple if you have one 15 04
let me do a quick look i have a guess it si not mandatory to do that so it s
if the page is not having the header set it ll use the one from mainview if you set this
o and it is not documented as we are not complete with that step yet 1
i guess that means i ca n t do it and this channel is only for idling ohkay not sure
well you pinged me with the question anyways the answer is you can do that but the docs are not
and i ve added that to the bug and it is not documented as we are not complete with that
and i ve added that to the bug well can you do that in the currently published framework 1
as far as the current published framework has the pageheader yes bug 1508363 in unity8 ubuntu coordinated migration to uitk
i think the page header is not set automatically you have to set it in order to get proper values
it s simple if you have one 15 04 1 framework you cna check whether pageheader is there or not
you mean programatically got a link to the mp in question 0
i m really just asking who can tell us which sdk version does the latest framework ensure i assume you
or by simply looking at the fs i do n t remember what was there exactly there were too many
however pageheader is relatively a new stuff so it may be missing from the fw i m really just asking
i can tell you for sure it was n t there but we need someone who can tell us what
thanks i ll look we have both running for now to find little things like this was n t it
or whenever o 0
i do n t know i m totally not involved with it we do n t export any apis be
i ve a feeling that either a the framework was defined prematurely or b the migration is premature since there
just note that the pagewithbottomedge used the header height as well talking with sil on ubuntu ci eng 1
i do n t even know who the uitk guys are exactly but looking at the source tree there is
be it just a published list of packages in ota6 or whenever was the framework introduced and if you feel
any future builds or re runs which you or ahayzen or anyone else can request should pass for this specific
what s going on with calculator failing here https code launchpad net gang65 ubuntu calculator app ubuntu calculator app math
i know ci was having some issues with jenkins yesterday that looks weird and probably related to that should ping
interesting so the old bot passed it but the new bot failed it i think it s failing to copy
talking with sil on ubuntu ci eng let me do a quick look i have a guess 1
it s because the ap tests failed however it s a bit weird because it s linking to a run
so it built things fine i was going to ask your thoughts on what to do with the ap gating
yw as far as the current published framework has the pageheader yes 0
did you track that down or was that lost to you just note that the pagewithbottomedge used the header height
got a link to the mp in question some interesting messages from the jenkins bot on weather debug failed continuous
i guess that means i ca n t do it and this channel is only for idling https code launchpad
can anyone tell me how to get the currentpage property object from a pagestack in autopilot thanks i ll look

so is there something we need to do for https code launchpad net gang65 ubuntu calculator app ubuntu calculator app
thanks for pointing that out balloons yes i can make it so calc and other issues like this can land

it broke after i upgraded to r163 really strange from the sounds of it 1
it is this ppa https launchpad net ci train ppa service archive ubuntu landing 039 not sure if it is
2015 06 17 17 57 13 debug files specified in dsc are broken or missing skipping package unpack verification there
right production reset was implemented before the device went into production trainguards i need silo 16 to be reconfigured can
lp 1419027 adding d bus method for production line reset used by the advanced factory reset use case oh right
so apparently it is all rsalveti s fault oh right 0
none now ok let me know when you ve got that qt5 package prepped and i ll copy it in
ooops well it boots normally and starts the wizard and at some point it does what you told it to
davmor2 i fear something is wrong with mako image r163 on channel ubuntu touch rc proposed ubuntu http paste ubuntu
cool now in a separate shell do this tail f var log system image client log davmor2 i just reflashed
oh great shell rotation was landed after the ota 1
i guess the checklicenseheaders sh needs to be updated indeed i had shell rotation on image r162 hell i even
trainguards hey any reason why silo 41 seems stuck version 8 02 15 04 20150603 1 0ubuntu1 1
right then that s older it should upgrade because there is apparently no phase for image 23 0
thanks davmor2 mirv the latest rc proposed image is now a snapshot image with ota 4 stuff in it 1
oh let me try running things manually on them 0
yeah that s what i was just thinking oh he did excellent 0
done you should have your shell rotation in a few hours 1
hmm yes clock app dev brb 0
btw will you make fahrplan rotation ready stuck but downloading 0
you want it to rotate i will see how it looks in landscape https jenkins qa ubuntu com job wily
then it s best to use stable one mp for non gles one for gles 0
you re on wifi right not when i am getting bug reports about clock app looking bad when running it
rc proposed is not a channel for app developers as it can have broken features yes 0
yeah i am reverting to r162 i was just surprised to experience this with r163 figured rc proposed just mean
no no rc proposed is a transient channel that indeed it has the latest development but in theory should be
take a screenshot it s racy and maybe the only time you ll see it yeah we better do it
oh but if you added a package i have to do it for you anyway hang on there is no
anything wrong 1
well sucks for me i guess i m a bit worried by the versioned dep 1
this one https code launchpad net canonical platform qa unity8 merge 256961 ah publishing thanks 0
i m a bit worried by the versioned dep scratch that it looks fine 1
was the es channel actually relesed i was just going to ask you about that 1
so finally your branch landed lol https code launchpad net ubuntu managed branches ubuntu system image system image most recent
you should have your shell rotation in a few hours sorry update what 1
the google doc 1
not rtm oh for the dual landing you mean 1
i was thinking more like this https code launchpad net bzoltan ubuntu ui toolkit 6 2015 gles merge 261832 but
yeah what can i say i do n t bug you when everything just works sadly no series reconfiguration usually
yes 0
thanks you were talking about a new workflow with git i blame that 0
in that silo ack mind reconfiguring silo 7 then 1
will have to re assign e g wipe existing packages you fine with that rebuild 0
yes i m a bit worried by the versioned dep 0
yeah sounds reasonable what would you suggest i can work around the other s in the unity code base for
looks like a number of bugs were actually fixed in it http changelogs ubuntu com changelogs pool main d devscripts
ohhh that sucks then oh for the dual landing you mean 0
well sucks for me i guess ok which is taken care of by https code launchpad net mir team platform
let me try running things manually on them did we get any fixes or am i just lucky 0
looks like they are all in a plugins dir should be possible to exclude that or where do they differ
yeah the regression appears to have been introduced in 2 15 5 which is still only in wily maybe the
the only solution i have so far is to exclude those specific files thanks guys 0
sounds ok for a temporary measure but not feeling really comfy with that in the long run hmm i do
ok how long would it take you to get into a silo 0
let me check if i can update that header to a slightly different format to make it pass or so
oh good to know i did n t realize that either ah cool i ll do that in future 1
channel ubuntu touch stable bq aquaris es cihelp seems our jenkins jobs started failing because of a license check but
you should have your shell rotation in a few hours are those files regularly updated from upstream 1
yeppers no 1
thanks you should have your shell rotation in a few hours 0
so it is probably the following of aliases thats not correct sil2100 yeah it redirects to bq aquaris en http
davmor2 what s the problem i d like to get started with testing the next one nevertheless will rebuild when
rvr has a real device it has n t upgraded yet no problems thanks for trying 0
greyback ok i ll sync up with mirv and see if i ca n t learn how to do this
ah yes sorry that package telepathy qt5 should be a source upload let me remove from the list of mps
errr no the branch should have a debian watch that scans for the non gles and rebuilds that package with
ah cool i ll do that in future aha so i remembered right 1
and from the ui there was no notification and nothing in software updates the easiest thing is if you just
nope no the gles one is only a fancy debian packaging branch which imports the code from the non gles
done can you interrupt the download and check again 1
yeah that s what i did let me try running things manually on them 0
you might want to kill system image dbus and let it get reactivated does n t matter there s rules
ok maybe i should just take a taxi instead and do normal uploads until we want to copy the packages
uuuu currently no i think robru wanted to add that once but he s busy with bileto the spreadsheet replacement
so the silo should actually be configured with manual uploads of qtmultimedia opensource src and qtmultimedia opensource src gles not
sil2100 finally silo028 is done right 1
sorry update what stuck but downloading 1
at the point where the log ends we are at the mercy of udm oh sorry that was supposed to
so if this is downloading then it knows there is an image available catimage 0
correct thanks a bunch in still an hour away from a keyboard 0
notification through the cli it s the console output thanks 0
my complain is that i have n t got any system update notification and the update screen is system settings
okay so let s do this the version mostly 0
2015 06 17 17 57 13 debug files specified in dsc are broken or missing skipping package unpack verification first
next kill any ubuntu download manager process that might still be running one mp for non gles one for gles
next kill any system image dbus process that might still be running i m not sure what to do about
kill any system settings process i e the ui yay 0
it s downloading now are you logged in 0
cool sometimes when udm gets confuzzled it confuzzles the whole stack upwards or i suppose you could try uploading it
if you really want some sneaky once if si 3 0 is landed you can bypass udm and use the
i worry more about users having this problem no reconfigure just build 0
i m not sure what to do about it i ve been asking for udm to get some love for
davmor2 i have a ubuntu community image for you guys to test killing all those processes usually gets things back
does system image cli cache requests somehow line 60 has some from greyback like 58 from mirv 0
sounds ok for a temporary measure but not feeling really comfy with that in the long run it does cache
i see well for shell rotation please wait a bit and it ll be back p 0
thanks okay not sure i know how to do that but i ll try 0
cool if you can add a changelog update to that mp we can get that updated thanks 0
done no the gles one is only a fancy debian packaging branch which imports the code from the non gles
yay can you change unreleased to wily 1
yeah i am reverting to r162 i was just surprised to experience this with r163 figured rc proposed just mean
in a meeting get back to you after done 1
indeed i had shell rotation on image r162 hell i even posted pictures of it on g thank you sir
so finally your branch landed just need a silo for line 61 please 1
thanks osomon yeah one of our goals is to expand user empowerment so that you guys are n t waiting
rc proposed is not a channel for app developers as it can have broken features silo 38 1
its the old function that was used in rtm not new at all that makes sense how is the spreadsheet
version not info http requests ci train staging ubuntu com it s a thing that exists i d say 90
if you adb shell what is the output of sudo system image cli vn yeah you and everybody else l0
http paste ubuntu com 11730629 but nothing changed in that branch 1
does n t matter there s rules in place enforcing gles variants always have matching version numbers if you re
so if you want to keep it a dual silo you ll have to figure out a way to do
or i guess it d be jenkins that would do the version bump well try putting that bzr builddeb dir
it is this ppa https launchpad net ci train ppa service archive ubuntu landing 039 not sure if it is
you re welcome gles is a special rebuild of the same package it needs to have the same contents as
no worries that s the strange image i mentioned oh interesting 1
line 60 has some from greyback like 58 from mirv the problem i m having is that after doing bzr
i was thinking more like this https code launchpad net bzoltan ubuntu ui toolkit 6 2015 gles merge 261832 but
but i m not sure if qtmultimedia opensource src gles is set up to use debian watch or not you
ehh mergeconflict i need to fix that too https jenkins qa ubuntu com job wily adt unity scope click lastbuild
now it is there ok thanks man 1
youre welceme 0
thanks one mp for non gles one for gles 1
ok so those two mp s are identical okay that s good at least 0
uuuu currently no i think robru wanted to add that once but he s busy with bileto the spreadsheet replacement
no the gles one is only a fancy debian packaging branch which imports the code from the non gles branch
upload to where what project qtubuntu 1
looking qtmultimedia opensource src 1
hmm i do n t know how that one is done sorry i had thought they were uploaded manually but
yeah i m not sure exactly how mirv does his because he usually does source uploads which are a little
can you use the ppa page to copy packages it s nothing train specific just needs a regular copy package
you re welcome thanks robru 0
aha so i remembered right ah yes sorry that package telepathy qt5 should be a source upload let me remove
vivid overlay what do you need for the source upload the dsc changes and the tarball itself 1
yep ok the only solution i have so far is to exclude those specific files 0
oh hrm what are you expecting to happen with a manual source upload in a dual silo sil2100 yeah it
i really do n t know d davmor2 so latest image in the rc proposed ubuntu channel is what you
well you probably want a second mp for the gles branch as well those need to be kept in sync
well we want to land this new telepathy in wily and on the vivid overlay too the only solution i
nice thanks yeah i think this is n t going to work the secondary build will try to copy the
i m stuck here so what would you suggest then we land in wily first and then sync to vivid
so if you want to keep it a dual silo you ll have to figure out a way to do
so tossing the silo and starting over is n t inherently insane maybe the sync silo approach will be easier
hmm interesting so basically a no change mr and then the silo will bump the release version numbers alright i
the problem i m having is that after doing bzr merge upstream path to tar gz and then bzr bd
nice thanks i just upgraded to 27 on my arale and see the sim pin disalog for the first time
no worries i know there s another one with unity in it 0
to a menu at the top that s probably higher priority 0
of the ci dashboard well sucks for me i guess 0
of the spreadsheet 0
how long would it take you to get into a silo sure working on it 1
did you pay your ticket do you see the menubar that s like file edit view addons help landing tools
omg up there np cjwatson is going to look into the issue i m having in a few hours or
welcome to google spreadsheets i wonder if mirv is around to explain how he manages his gles packages 0
do n t worry in a month this ll all be gone and you ll have to relearn the new
oh but if you added a package i have to do it for you anyway hang on it s okay
so i configured the silo the right way around but it s up to you to get those packages prepared
take a screenshot it s racy and maybe the only time you ll see it oh great 1
make sure you delete the source packages from the source package column then that ll screw things up vivid overlay
alright i ll make it a wily silo for now ah ok 1
understood no clear maintainer afaik people only touch it when they have to 1
yeah i think that ll work best scratch that it looks fine 0
dang very hard to parse the spreadsheet but that s nothing you do n t already know o bots 0
ack sure i can 1
could you please trigger a rebuild of latest vivid build of telephony service on ppc64el on silo 20 how long
thanks for the patience 1 mins for the normal package it seems i just uploaded the normal package to the
correct so it s building now https launchpad net ci train ppa service archive ubuntu landing 038 packages 1
oh awesome thanks for doing that please bfiller already tested it just need a code review 0
warning this will wipe all user data on the device have a good one 1
okay sorry i do n t know how to do that let s wait for robru to return and then
no problems thanks for trying this is on a mako nexus 4 0
thanks for the assistance can you use the ppa page to copy packages it s nothing train specific just needs
i tried copy package but it failed can you interrupt the download and check again 0
https launchpad net ci train ppa service archive ubuntu landing 040 there s nothing in your ppa upload is being
for boiko s request if you go to the page for his ppa click package details there s a button
i m still afk sorry family visiting and then fire up the system settings ui and start a check for
so it seems platform api lacks any autopkgtests that would catch this for one thing maybe at some poit it
i missed the delayed shutdown ah cool i guess you ca n t copy package from one ppa to another
okay sorry i do n t know how to do that let s wait for robru to return and then
3 0 1 0ubuntu1 should be higher than any previous upload but i guess i ll bump it to 3
telepathy qt5 to copy to silo 39 not rtm 1
got it question same destination series i e wily rebuild copied source or copy existing binaries missing sa in the
let me check if i can update that header to a slightly different format to make it pass or so
if version bump fails ping an lp person to get the upload failure message train does n t get them
sounds ok for a temporary measure but not feeling really comfy with that in the long run rebuild 1
thanks robru ack 1
mzanetti fix is in silo 22 which is testing pass ready to publish now ack 1
so wily i think rebuild is better because my private ppa has only x86 builds i need the armhf one
done let s see what happens lol so while we were talking greyback went ahead and discovered on his own
thanks a bunch in still an hour away from a keyboard at the point where the log ends we are
you re welcome user data on the device 0
okay you should kill that and then use ps to find the ubuntu download manager and kill that so after
i d like to get started with testing the next one nevertheless will rebuild when the previous lands now that
oh right 0
i thought mirv had prepared it already maybe i misunderstood what exactly he did sorry i was afk earlier did
ack i m just rereading it now my understanding is that he was explaining what to do i just configured
sil2100 finally silo028 is done alright but he kicked off a build of it 1
in that silo of the ci dashboard 0
well i guess i know what i m doing for the rest of this week oh he did excellent 1
indeed so i think we re good for now no reconfigure just build 0
so what would you suggest then we land in wily first and then sync to vivid overlay ok so that
awesome thanks for looking into this though apparently not is casey jones driving this thing 0
at some point between now and publication time you ll have to figure out the gles half which is still
launchpad bug 1466098 in devscripts ubuntu licensecheck fails to parse copyright if a is contained undecided new alright 1
gles is only used in the emulator so basically make sure current silo works on device then fix up gles
the problem i m having is that after doing bzr merge upstream path to tar gz and then bzr bd
should be fine dobey is landing a fix for that soon 1
mzanetti fix is in silo 22 which is testing pass ready to publish now yeah what can i say i
cool sometimes when udm gets confuzzled it confuzzles the whole stack upwards could you please trigger a rebuild of latest
lol so while we were talking greyback went ahead and discovered on his own what happens when you have a

it wants two spaces after the e mail if apt get source has a newer version sure 0
anyway stuff we ve simplified here often packaging is in bzr or debian git so it s best to get

otherwise we would have to refresh the patch each time we update the version tickets as in bugs or the

anyways can you remove things from the scneario xubuntudocking can you remove any hubs etc and plug one monitor right
any relevant information from the creators of the hardware if you say they promise linux support share that documentation could
then i guess you should connect philips and ask what they mean why much people do n t like systemd
good luck the blue vga cable should work easily and you can use the usb hub for the mouse and
sure it works with windows but was a driver needed anyways thats just to look at what the company implies
the vga cable will likely just work if thats an option though you should also try bypassing the docking station
try unplugging everything else and only taking a usb cord from one monitor directly to the usb on the linux

yes it s a known hack that they need to remove it s good 0
let me try to find more information are you available 0
i m going to add to the ci backlog a card for running the ubuntu ota tests i mean i
for now this is not going to bite us but maybe it raises the priority for them to remove the

this problem wo n t impact the other merge proposals have a look at http bazaar launchpad net brendan donegan
it s good how much time is it taking for you to run the sanity daily 0
ok to overwrite your branch i am 0
when you say set up the job is that the header for the next 2 steps or are you saying
well yes but courtesy yeah i ll aim to do that by eod 0
this problem wo n t impact the other merge proposals if you get that loop failing reliably please send an

a suggestion would be for us to provide a mechanism a script i guess that generates a config file and
i haven t thanks for the pointer ubuntu bug 1424586 in snappy ubuntu snappy selftest fake newer version for upgrade
this definitely has nothing to do with the sdk i was just wondering what kind of errors have you encountered
let s talk about it oh thanks that s useful 1
take a look at http paste ubuntu com 10817742 i ll add some more details to the gdoc above on
are you available that s perfect thanks 1
ok to overwrite your branch i ve been running it while i m running power stuff on another device right
a suggestion would be for us to provide a mechanism a script i guess that generates a config file and
got it thanks hopefully it wo n t be too difficult to land the other two branches from here 0
yeah the sanity is able to provision the network 1
the readme in the sanity suite states the test suite requires that a network is available to download the test
was trying to find a place to put a unit test but did n t see any there must be
actually lets roll back do you think setting up the phone network should be a task of the provisioning tool
there needs to be a network connection before the tests right for adb to d l all the req deps
it depends on how you define a test when does the test start when we run ubuntu sanity test or
got it thanks well i would say that the tests are called blah anything else is the wrapper so maybe

if you make a branch with the test i can debug on krillin here when you say set up the

that makes me a little nervous as that s outside our normal operations creating maintaining jenkins job but perhaps that
but it seems we have uncovered a problem though so maybe working around it is n t ideal what i
that sounds ok we give ci all the commands needed to run the test are you available 0
right we should work closely with them though i do n t like the idea of throwing this stuff over
indeed it does n t fail on krillin yes i agree with everything you have said 1
the problem we found was that steps 1 and 2 were in the same script not easy to modify i
you re using the initctlenv fixture to set that on the case of boottest it s actually not that easy
right we should work closely with them though i do n t like the idea of throwing this stuff over

ah right i was a little confused which test it was still thinking of the sanity tests there must be

wich channel did you install do you have a python script handy 0
try devel proposed maybe but existing chroots will not get the overlay ppa automatically 0
i thought devel0 proposed was off not sure wich channel worsk best for n10 1
me neither but nexus7 does best on devel proposed 1
devs told me devel proposed works best for tablets yay it s alive 0
at least in portrait on mx4 have you check xda forums for existing projects 1
not a bad way to work its not crashing 1
o wonder if we could re order that still no mouse cursor on my phone when a bt keyboard and
wich channel did you install there is something in a silo somewhere that makes it work talk to mhall119 1
well it was supposed to land soon there should not be any big technical issue there possibly some tweaks needed
yea soon but not sure of the date do you have any examples somewhere 0
does n t help track down reasons we see loaded dbus though p i do n t expect it i
feel free to file a bug against the file manager ubuntu touch devel ubuntu 0
huh it should not be run as root now it s doing something or gallery it may need to change
https wiki ubuntu com multitouch it s this one alex abreu worked on that a while back not sure if
alright i actually thought so it s just that this channel is linked in the wiki about multitouch support p
dbarth so it seems chrome should recommends the webapps but that common is not useful on the default ubuntu iso
yes do you have any examples somewhere 1
where is that used how do i access it as an user http bazaar launchpad net phablet team webapps core
interesting hm i saw similar code in lp ubuntu system tests they were tests for the web apps as well
it s exiting there was no attempt to work directly w the webbrowser app per se but it should work
if it does not i can help tweak it make it read thses vars from somewhere else from a writable
i ll give it another try and get back to you i did try it a few hours ago but
ok we do n t seem to have any webapp on the issue should we remove the container then i
the issue the release you mean have you check xda forums for existing projects 0
sorry meant on the iso https twitter com romangeber status 656835916426825728 0
do you know what webbrowser app is used for on unity7 atm do we still have some sort of webapps
awe did make a fix that we think helped but did not fix things so that would make sense good
for me the dbus spikes seem to be much shorter on ota7 my phone has been fairly usable at work
var lib ubuntu location service seems appropriate well it is still needed since it also deals w webapp installation enablement
make it read thses vars from somewhere else from a writable loaction i would rather propose to provide a debugging
where s my mouse cursor it will be needed once webbrowser app deals with that 1
https wiki ubuntu com multitouch it s this one yes 1
otherwise we re all just guessing ah thanks 1
occupy cloud so for old chroots if there is a reason to kepp them you need to add the overlay
use the vertices mcphail thanks 1
will take a long time one way or the other today my internet connection is very slow today it would
also i love that only uk people get that in that case the ubuntu sdk api 15 04 package from
doesnt that make you feel young again the unity 3d deb file is 1gb plus you still need to install
whatever you prefer then but as i have heard cough all snappy apps will size 140mb at least and that
http themcphails uk snappy jpg errr no i work for a supercomputing facility and somehow turned one of our test
ah thanks hahahaha 1
okay in this case i ll just move the heavy processing to the cloud and ssh into my work machines
sure but it s not even that great compared to where i live you have a blender render farm we

aah nice we can alter the flags at runtime without problem 0
so the question i have is does geis interact with grail or does compiz interact with grail directly and where
also i love that only uk people get that when i connect a bt keyboard and mouse to my mx4
too near the bone still no mouse cursor on my phone when a bt keyboard and mouse is connected 0
it is awfully close to the open keyboard button that way too alright i actually thought so it s just
right unity webapps common is in the desktop seed it was added with unity firefox extension 0
been there done that it s what led to my last patch of nm does n t help track down
good does it still work and load dbus daemon right i ca n t 0
in order to do so i had to fake out will take a long time one way or the other
want to reproduce that step 0
osomon yes also when i was in central sq 1
is it the android hal qcom hardware or alsa pulseaudio in ubuntu touch that is taking care of switching to
i do n t know how to explain it i can trigger it by walking around i do n t
it might have more to do with trying to connect to aps and then going out of range than number
there was no attempt to work directly w the webbrowser app per se but it should work w a minimal
maybe but again we need to nail down the scenario yeah i remember patching upstart to not emit those as
or gallery it may need to change its content set it does seem to happen more often when the system
but oom is n t directly killing the dbus process so i dunno try devel proposed maybe 0
sudo cpulimit l 1 c 1 p pidof dbus daemon i was just looking dbus myself 0
is pretty effective for reproducing behavior of loaded dbus there was no attempt to work directly w the webbrowser app
does n t help track down reasons we see loaded dbus though p oh for tablets maybe 0
one other theory is that we have a bad dbus clent on the system right 0
i do n t like this bug not like ces 0
where do i find the link to that page spent half a night figuring out why the microphone was n
https en wikipedia org wiki this is what the openmovie scenario remind me of sorry for ot link a bug
if you check your personal launchpad it s there also is that assigned later 0
the bugnumber becomes the name of your personal package how s it going 0
the bugnumber becomes the name of your personal package funny commit log btw p 1
thaks for your patience guys read you soon generally you d want the commit messages to reflect the actual changes
best to do a bit of checking first does ubuntu have the latest that debian has well since you follow
that s not true though then save user settings quit blender start jack open blender and set av sync 0
that is confusing i need to make one file for each testcase and if i have to wait for reviewm
in fact that s how you messed it up d ok i think i get it 1
because i think you did something wrong there p hmm i ca n t see the difference with what noklam
ofc i did something wrong hehe p heh 0
what should be done instead https code launchpad net ubuntu manual tests code field lifecycle merged field lifecycle empty marker
for example this is n t right either noklam it s done by bzr commit m text of what you
you re welcome of course i m preaty sure i got it of one of the ubuntu websites 1
in fact that s how you messed it up d it is my first ever so i expect it to
not my decision just a guess on my part as to why what should be done instead 1
did i mention how much i love blender d no that s the right more usual way 1
hmm i ca n t see the difference with what noklam wrote https en wikipedia org wiki this is what
so feature not bug d you re welcome of course 1
what should i do then file a bug where do i find the link to that page 0
of course for scirbus need to sleep will look into the blender branche tomorrow 0
did i mention how much i love blender d best to do a bit of checking first does ubuntu have
last time i worked on 2 files with bzr it kept pushing commits to the 1st file where s the
jack is running because i think you did something wrong there p 0
that should not be new code jack is running touching any of the options in audio makes blender freeze 1
file user preferences system tab how s it going 0
yeah the scenarios of the openmovies are not always very good i think they work on it collectively a bit
ok cool so if the scribus file should n t be in the blender branch should i pull a new
you did n t have to do a new mp either btw zequence so let s have an offtopic channel
thanks i will pass that on the move was suggested by gustavo i cant want to answer for him i
sadness you want facundo git repository name 0
junk is only for bzr ok thanks that s what i thought 0
thanks you want facundo git repository name 1
the lack of action links is not a bug but the empty portlet should not be shown see https help
it s now public again i d not really noticed the hide link i ve done that myself now thanks
filed as bug 1511559 lp admins and the commenter themselves 1
i ve got to go away from the computer now so i ve set it to private security for the
thanks this is what i m doing git push set upstream git ssh facundo git launchpad net facundo junk branchname
private ppas do public ones do not hey i got a code importer question we want a non head git
lp admins and the commenter themselves ok thanks that s what i thought 1
does that apply to ftp too or are ppas http only and right that definitely looks like forged from address
trying to answer someone on ask ubuntu normally you create branches repositories simply by pushing to them i do n
lol nope not logged out hm i get build failures in the livefs build for https launchpad net ubuntu cdimage
oh well we just turned webhooks on for beta testers hopefully better ci will be on its way thanks will
the ability to register a branch in the ui was removed in 2012 as far as i can see oh
there is the import a branch link on project code pages but not on person code pages does that apply
oh project owners as well i believe but not the world at large dobey that cached page would be surprising
oh well we just turned webhooks on for beta testers hopefully better ci will be on its way there s
a few hours ago i am sure i was able to create new branches repos on launchpad however now i
uh just lost what i was typing silly ipad houses on pontoons you know it makes sense and yes they
what are the options i do n t know 0
like also what s the browser like on the ubuntuphone can i do things like block ads and visit sites
you ca n t turn off efi computers only have one firmware on modern ones it s efi to an
why turn off uefi makes literally no sense 1
hi will go and twiddle the nvidia driver to the newest one 0
yes not buying entroware since to expensive for what actually get yes 1
that would n t be a compliant implementation they are simply cheap so not full hd not ips poor viewing
hm not without doing one of those things ubuntu s boot loader has been signed with the verisign microsoft key
ubuntu s boot loader has been signed with the verisign microsoft key for ages so works out of the box
ati s driver is crap on linux intersingly the one on the hp site with intel processor and graphics is
so can i type in a key and then secure boot will allow ubuntu to run but not windows 8
you can remove the verisign key and add the individual signatures of ubuntu s binaries and your device firmwares it
intrbiz did you go on the two links i linked to earlier what is your budget 1
many parts of a system basically do n t change between revisions so the older one is n t more
waistband portable tbh for a laptop the cpu would be of lesser concern for me than screen battery life and
yeah but i ve asked via chat and they refer 4 times to the t c if it s for
only happened recently so shrug the solution is simple then make another account and fold the money to yourself on
also beware of efi stuff that ca n t be turned off if it ships with windows my wife had
ugh and is there a way to tell oemstrip to leave some files untouched oh maybe my patch is n
network manager pptp which i had already started do you have patch 2 7 3 1 1
and i guess it really depends how fast the phone can get ported over no 2 7 1 7 hence
oh you mean the specific packages hmm anyhow i could fix the git updates patch but really patch needs fixing
in the systemd package i worked around that by changing my patch to not create a dangling symlink but it
yes indeed if you tried to rebuild to make shlibdeps go away then i think perhaps it has a hardcoded
given that my git updates patch is auto generated i do n t really want to mangle it to work
thanks for the bug pointer though i was stumped yw 0
yeah me too when i saw the systemd bug report unrelated how do i find reverse dependencies for a virtual
was that what you pinged me about last night echo in here 0
through through it was yeah 1
that might be on purpose i do n t but you asked me a question to which i do n
wom 21 you can force the result in the history file 1
ok doing that then i did the same for a similar case recently but it s happending seldomly enough and
and found an issue jan 27 14 39 30 in target the following packages have unmet dependencies ok doing that
except to no change rebuild in vivid and future development releases which we need for proposed migration unless the dependencies
tks 7000km just strech your arm a bit maybe we should get some kind of upstream agreement 1
ah look at that i just opened the code which i should have done before opening my mouth we do
in december archives lennart said that he will take patches that cleanly implement logic as specified to unwant if symlink
but not on the global symlinks oh you mean the specific packages hmm 0
yeah but it s kind of convenient to have whilst hacking on these things usr share bug xserver xorg core
great plus e g i imagine we would want packaging to use system global to genere symlinks at package built
tks 7000km just strech your arm a bit well i would really wait for the sprint as there is no
done i need this not for debian 1
i m on it in the evening just the demotions 1
btw if you want to write anything which is portable between init systems do n t use systemctl but invoke
should do i to upload isdnutils right now in the systemd package i worked around that by changing my patch
ah so we only need to rebuild few packages not all of them thanks a lot 1
good morning so if you d be nice to answer it would be good because we re staying in the
launchpad still thinks pyqt5 is in main https launchpad net ubuntu source pyqt5 5 4 dfsg 1 ubuntu1 publishinghistory thanks
i m not blocking it ok doing that then i did the same for a similar case recently but it
right that s one of the first items in the pkgproblemresolver output ok i ll upload it 1
and found an issue jan 27 14 39 30 in target the following packages have unmet dependencies oh yes i
ok isdnutils is dep waiting already given that my git updates patch is auto generated i do n t really
hm is that a timeout or something i do n t see an error message libguestfs0 still depends libsystemd journal0
https launchpadlibrarian net 195907605 vivid ppc64el openjdk b22 txt gz could it be that this is just a large build
i did n t bother to fully investigate but it s fairly clear from appliance depends as for your question
that would be all or nothing if i remember correct it is very usual issue when playing around with a
so if you d be nice to answer it would be good because we re staying in the place https
these two binaries were shipped in isdnutils but they have been splitted out to separate source libcapi20 3 link above
we do i saw you ve merged nm applet have you been dreaming about that 1
hi can you please look at bug 1409433 i guess you ve spent a half of night p 1
i have made a cockup on some software which has been deployed to some of our customers in essence when
ok i hope in a few hours rebuilds are ready i m actually having trouble installing them getting dependency errors
yay cjwatson no i already checked that debian control does n t have a hardcoded dep it did but i
dktrkranz ping https bugs launchpad net ubuntu cdimage since that s an image build problem 1
thanks does usr sbin service need any additional logic to start stop status systemd services 0
not bad if i remember correct it is very usual issue when playing around with a daily image this kind
libguestfs0 still depends libsystemd journal0 this one is because the image build system s mirror did n t get properly
understood thanks for the clear explanation well i would really wait for the sprint as there is no clear agreement
many thanks sir at the moment only did a trivial systemctl system global enable to generate symlinks in lib 0
ah so we only need to rebuild few packages not all of them mmm ok so if i depend on
need to rebuild everything that depended on the old abi about 50 i just uploaded the rebuilds a few minutes
through through ah nice so every package which did get an upload will at least trigger its own test and
ah ok they do n t have anything in particular in their status other than an obsolete error message so
thanks for the heads up looks like it s been blocked from jessie for almost a year for the same
ack sorry i did n t warn in advance i do n t know how else i could have approached
no problem at all the smiley was deliberate unless the dependencies are wrong 0
bah so who broke php what do you mean wrt new logic 1
btw if you want to write anything which is portable between init systems do n t use systemctl but invoke
exactly fwiw i wrote usr sbin service many moons ago no problem if there s anything i can do to
oh that was you did n t know that no 2 7 1 7 hence why i could n t
indeed well i would really wait for the sprint as there is no clear agreement even with debian on the
good morning the earliest code was a port from rh but it grew far beyond that with upstartedness 1
do you need to review i thought i have permissions anyway i was just wondering if it needed anything else
yeah i saw as far as i m aware invoke rc d and service fully support all three now 1
utopic s still had some bugs though so i m talking vivid here otherwise running enable and iterating moving things
oh maybe my patch is n t up to date did n t see the bug was patch not dpkg
ah look at that i just opened the code which i should have done before opening my mouth and not
cve 2015 0235 no worries at all 1
thanks that was fast on github 0
we do no problem if there s anything i can do to speed things up do drop me a line
good morning that machine uses ifenslave yes and i ll check in about two weeks 1
just the demotions ok using ifenslave is the most important bit of it i do n t know if there
with ifenslave the reason for the hang was quite clear that might be on purpose 0
so should be all good now thanks for the bug pointer though i was stumped 0

re ask your issue here once in a while details where you stuck yep thats how apt works 1
it s called bluray you might need to do an update 1
general use when chrome was just coming out it worked like crap so i stuck with chromium ls al etc
how does apt know where to look given just ppa some thing justcurious this is a support channel ask ubuntu
maybe try a driver switch from additional drivers section to see if it makes any difference on your ssh what
it looks a launchpad net and creates a ppa entry in etc apt sources list d and i gave a
i found the fualty ppa that is blocking the update equivalent chmod ug rwx a rx run media basil 0
sudo apt get install ppa purge just keep 1 lines of unique 3 column 0
so launchpad net has a list of all ppa s o hello 0
purging all now gon na restart my browser 0
do you have a separate home after that was successful or its even installed do sudo ppa purge ppa oibaf
i asume you do n t have the gust addons installed why do n t you just use add apt
curious about what exactly i have the lv root wich is cached on a ssd 0
maybe there is a list of all ppas but i dont have that link now mykeyboward is n t letting

i reproduce the error when running anything that uses opengl including the output in that pastebin think you can get

so if you know the file name then you can try locate filename sure but say i wanted to start

it would help if you explained what you re trying to accomplish and then apt get update 0

see https partner images canonical com core trusty 20151001 ubuntu trusty core cloudimg amd64 manifest which matches the docker image
i m pretty baffled as to how that could happen by accident some expensive ssd might do internal raid where
for example the ssd controller spreads read and write operations over all the memory chips in the solid state drive
the versions are there but apache installs correctly tiering is n t caching 0
yes apache does install correclty tiering is n t caching 0
so this is n t to do with proposed ending up on the image it s just the image being
i need always type sudo route add default gw 192 168 0 1 but wich fileneed modify for make it
when i run dmesg on my server it says segmentation fault core dumped my var log syslog says this line
it is that the docker image ships a package from trusty proposed without trusty proposed in sources list also thought
and it should n t have a package from trusty proposed anyway my guess from them in ubuntu they re
emmcs could be nice for tiering though i m checking how docker does their builds 1
that depends on how you cache is it something you deliver or not in our ubuntu hands 1
we deliver the base image and then they do somethings to it tiering is n t caching 0
what s the benefits they as in docker 1
gateway 192 168 0 1 perhaps so the image that we delivered to docker has 3 4 0 2ubuntu1 1
ok so it sounds like they re doing something broken i m checking how docker does their builds 0
and they really work well i ll ask kirkland to pass to docker upstream 1
looking thanks 1
that is my 0 02 the cloud image team does have relationships with the docker guys you probably also would
i had lunch with them on thursday last incidently nm i figured out what was my problem thank you all
i think this is caused by the python 3 4 3 release to and subsequent removal from the trusty archive
so this is n t to do with proposed ending up on the image it s just the image being
hitachi makes those things whoa we did that i m surprised it was pulled in that way instead of putting
do you have a bug number handy good morning 0
http pastie org 10476820 so it would be be useful to know if this is a company thing or some
exactly there is no gateway defined so i ll orchestrate getting a new image out but we know the root
so i guess the question is whether the base image includes python from trusty proposed or trusty proposed in sources
do n t feel ignored and repeat your question quickly if nobody knows your answer nobody will answer you while

you still should n t crosspost but it makes sense to move data from lower tiers like 7k2 drives to

please do n t ask to ask a question simply ask the question all on one line and in the

system should n t crash that s what the reserved blocks are for you do n t spread reads only
well unless daemons run as root i guess royk i have installed ubuntu 14 04 basic no gui installed but
or even why you need partitions just reading the first paragraph of http www howtogeek com 196541 emmc vs ssd

it s more like a test for a very small and low power consuming system i would n t no
how to connect usb modem to enable internet on ubuntu 14 04 server also i would n t cramp so
i would also take a ssd instead if i would have the appropriate interfaces for it this looks concerning 0
what s the benefits is it something you deliver or not in our ubuntu hands 0
well if you have say 10tb of data usually 10 or perhaps 20 of the data is hot so you
utlemmin do you look after the docker image that ends up being fetched as ubuntu trusty by users with multiple
a subseqent install of libapache2 mod wsgi py3 fails though as described uio no has 10pib or so ranging from

cern is also using a tiering system cern s tiering system is a caching system 1

thank you very much unpacking cloud image utils from cloud image 27 0ubuntu9 deb 0
the issue is that installed cloud image utils causes cloud utils to be removed happy to test it holler if
ah yes o 1
possibly or provide force via a third party tool like the stuff to remove juju now d 1
and hai how goes 1
juju destroy environment force ec2 does just that juju destroy server is what you need to kill a jes good
http reviews vapour ws r 949 for some of the cleanups that i ve done so far i m wanting
big deal k will see what i can do 1
good plan so i m not repeating myself 0
so if it were in a less unhelpfully samed package i may take urulama off the approval list 1
k 1
sinzui happy to apply the fix to 1 20 as well and i m wanting to get moving on this
understand hehe 0
you ll have to have a code or something to enter with giant warnings like this block stuff getting implemented
see https docs google com a canonical com document d edit for the original stuff on it so there s
right but they re all trying to work in the space of your problem so whatever you do should take
i think perhaps a developer plugin like the juju nuke plugin saying that if force is going to potentially do
well they should come into play stupid freenode conection 0
the problem with all these solutions is they do n t take into account the force option really this behaviour
yes i think we do in general just want our own tomb right but they re all trying to work
1 20 is not broken and we are n t release it any more just 1 22 and master need
k possibly or provide force via a third party tool like the stuff to remove juju now 1
right agree with that have a good trip 0
ah yes i think perhaps a developer plugin like the juju nuke plugin 1
i am not being an incredible fan of http reviews vapour ws r 947 diff 2 why is it that
yeah the current package is state watcher i was feeling pretty happy with this document before 1
perhaps we have to remove the force option altogether let me know if there s anything i can do to
but been on the road 12 hrs today so going to go to bed and crash cheers 0

bug 1416928 juju agent using lxcbr0 address as apiaddress instead of juju br0 breaks agents api lxc network juju core
yep before i committed the previous fix i tested on aws the bug refers to an aws ci test i
yes but 0
i just attached the cloud init output log to https bugs launchpad net juju core 1 22 bug 1423036 i
same region lol 0
wallyworld i have experienced differences in aws over different regions before will do 0
good example wallyworld i think this case is broader since the precise machine in hp and precise tests in joyent
i can see the joyent pulled the old package from the real archive but lp does agree the new package
i need to sleep when i look at http ubuntu cloud archive canonical com ubuntu dists precise updates cloud tools
but i can see that proposed does know about the new packaged http ubuntu cloud archive canonical com ubuntu dists
do you have any idea about the archive issues i think her current work addresses some of this 0
thanks waigani we should hold off on the destroy environment landing until we get some agreement on the spec 1
possibly or provide force via a third party tool like the stuff to remove juju now please hold off any
create a channel close it in the func rather than wg add select over that channel and the tomb so
cool waigani we should hold off on the destroy environment landing until we get some agreement on the spec 1
i was wondering about that please hold off any more reviewing until you me and waigani have had a chat
if an old cloud utils is used the issue as per the failed ci test occurs is that due to
dunno if u saw it with ur connection misbehaving and all live tests on maas pass ok 0
looks good to me too is eric s stamp not okay re proposed ptal http reviews vapour ws r 941
thanks heyhey just finished with domas 1
hey brb i ll be in leader election hangout when you re available just using the restroom quickly hey 0
case ok self resource changes hey 1
self tomb kill self loop seen your comments on gh some are already done in the pr 1
but still move anything related to networks when are you off 0
some of the issues you ve resolved already just sync up with menn0 and perrito666 at least it uses a
yeah it s older but still networking related and used by the firewaller iirc just saying it should fit whatever
so if it were in a less unhelpfully samed package hi was just looking at that bug 1
cheers remeber i love my job i love my job 0
hey so the foreport to 1 22 should be easy but let s talk about the fix during after standup
i m going to chase up john too will do 1
the for loop not sure if they still operate weirdly 0
ah yes hence for loop 0
yes i think we do in general just want our own tomb return resource ensureerr self resource 0
maybe the archive is not really at the state lp thinks it is this is true for releasing juju i
and i think it s generally nice practice to pull the loop out into its own method returning an error
i think i remember how to do it right i m going to chase up john too 0
so if it were in a less unhelpfully samed package 0
please hold off any more reviewing until you me and waigani have had a chat it would be clear that
oh wait maybe watchers have stop methods where workers have kill and wait just saying it should fit whatever you
gaah sometimes i really hate that ui 0
have you tried live testing this by bootstraping a manual environment to a machine with and without the lxc package
but see these fixes become fractally tentacular if we renot careful i m wanting more feedback on my spec btw
i think the worker interface is saner cheers will look soon 1
looks good to me too is eric s stamp not okay probably best to wait for wallyworld 0
i was told to wait for a more sneior reviewer yep just doing it with local provider looks good so
i m going to chase up john too done 1
so basically what i mean is you are using params networkhostports to convert a member of params apihostports i am
s fi fyi well borrowing from python p better explicit 1
what botters me the most is that i see a lot of params networkhostports someparam servers i liked it a
yeah you get network want params get params want network be with you in a sec 0
and hai could you point me to file and line 1
http reviews vapour ws r 949 for some of the cleanups that i ve done so far gim me a
thx yes here it creates the network hostports out of the params hostports 1
and those are mypackage hostport which are struct gna in machineports 0
yeah and this change already went too large not in the sense of structure but changed places i used to
yeah but i d rather get it landed thanks 0
i ll have a look force does n t fail if the api is broken 0
sinzui happy to apply the fix to 1 20 as well how to get all this done sanely and quickly
if ok which fix 1
i ve pulled your branches with the foreports and once i m done with live testing themue s changes i
ok so what turns out tests run better when the heatsink is n t dangling off your northbridge top computer
ocr ptal http reviews vapour ws r 951 running actions while unit is in hook error state without clearing the
this special environment thing is going to kill us lol 1
are there instructions for live testing or is it in your head yeah and this change already went too large
seen your comments on gh some are already done in the pr in my head but i can try to
hmm i ll send them by mail 1
thanks re proposed ptal http reviews vapour ws r 941 0
just had 1 1 and during this time i ve seen an error on ec2 have to look for the
hmm maybe already found it 1 0
i m testing on maas first i ll stamp it then all my live tests went fine 0
ah fine so different providers yep no way to do it on accident 0
interesting just read lenovo creates super computer based on arm thought i found it but can not get the reason
you can easily test if your changes caused this but i doubt it switch to master rebuild bootstrap but stop
could you point me to file and line yes will check it this way 1
will do hi perrito666 0
cheers np not urgent i wanted to check something else with you 0
ok so what live tests on maas pass ok 1
ah great info thanks seems to be local you can easily test if your changes caused this but i doubt
oops s backports foreports that is sure 1
ta ah good idea i missed that 1
no i just ran the built in tests and i m wanting to get moving on this asap 0
the metadata for cloud utils was wrong and the fix is in the above do you know how to do
as i ve removed many references to other things out of the scope of the spec sweet please give it
will do 1 0
when you re around give me a ping it looks like you can slap me the error seems to be
ok might have to be after soccer it s nice to create new build but the path should be set
so what s the issue as i ve removed many references to other things out of the scope of the
none anymore currently it s running find but during the last try with the error above i used some old
path had been set wrong not using my fresh builds so basically what i mean is you are using params
right that s why i have my rebuild juju script always in path if ok 0
bug 1420049 is now confirmed to be a regression with 1 20 we need someone to address it yep changed
manual bootstrap also works when you re around give me a ping 0
when there are possibly multiple environments ec2 looks fine so far too waiting for the latest steps to complete 1
well its always good not having to drag all the baggage x86 has yes will check it this way 0

15 06 i think i m able to connect to my other server properly which is configured with windows it
oh it is possible just not with the installer that the ubuntu server iso comes with email clients dont really
so imap uses port 587 for actually sending mail via tls say a machine in the same vlan gets owned
when debugging mail problems it s best to use the simplest tools ever nc to specific hosts on specific ports
test from localhost from inside the same dc from outside the dc etc why is that not a server so
imap uses different ports none 25 if you re still here i simply enabled ssl smtp which appears to have
smb hallyn libvirt 1 2 16 is building in my ppa zulcss libvirt testing ppa pre up in etc network

if you need more features e g ability to install packages with apt get you might have better results booting

if you need more features e g ability to install packages with apt get you might have better results booting
what is your aversion for ra something to look at next methinks 0
i am curious that is if you re testing using full blown mtas you ll drive yourself insane quickly 0
that is for ifupdown not systemd networkd ok 1
got it thanks a lot very sad jpds ok thanks i will try the live debian image first not sure
ok you could basically take one of the live cd s and boot with the text kernel parameter 1
ok i am checking http live debian net you mean you get some errornous ipv6 address 0
cool i ll make a note to test that in a bit for example freenas org 0
oh it is possible just not with the installer that the ubuntu server iso comes with what do you want
well that s not a live server either that s a live image it can run live but it s
a live server is just booting the server from usb and load it to ram and running from ram depends
i think you ll be far off running it in a vm change the graphics type disable splash 0
i am not an expert i am not very sure a server supposed to have less space faster performance etc
it worked thank you tarpman lordievader s suggestion of regular live cd and text mode matches that ubuntu server is
thanks a lot in any case you ca n t try ubuntu server like you can the desktop 1
thanks a lot you want it to use dhcp6 0
follow the prompts eventually you will have the option of mounting your existing system and getting a shell in it
i see damnit i tried the desktop one but it does n t boot because the server doesnt have real
how does rescue mode work though it goes into a command line gui screen to start doing stuff i just
sometimes in server land you want to do a fully static config even for gateway thats all follow the prompts
yes if you need more features e g ability to install packages with apt get you might have better results
for example freenas org thats what im trying to do desktop text mode but i ca n t get it
ok boot with text nomodeset interesting i m curious why postfix is set up to use port 25 by default
should i remove the quiet splash server installer should still have rescue mode 0
up to you nomodeset forces splash to be disabled iirc removing quiet just means you see more kernel messages otherwise
yeah is nomodeset still going to work 1
or just set ipv6 to manual or add it to etc sysctl conf yes 1
i m not sure how that interacts with the if it s still giving you grief i d try dropping
yes we have bugs https bugs launchpad net ubuntu source upstart bug 1422681 hello all 0

well paraphrased because we felt they ve been around for ages they should apply 0
np wrangle some transitions out of proposed 0
and the transitional flags were false and false ancient stuff from way way back when ci train was first brought
do we have anything else we need to talk about interesting thanks 1
note that lp cupstream2distro config is different and currently unrelated to lp cupstream2distro worked with robru on debugging uci engine
they are free software no doubt about that ianal but all canonical asks for is a conversation if you intend
let me check i do not see it as an excuse riddell but i would like to ask you to
and yes what slangasek said it sounds a lot like the trigger change endmeeting 0
do you know if a bug is open for it ubuntu is free software 0
preparation for cts sprint congrats on 10 years of kubuntu btw that s an amazing milesgtone 1
you could try to ping locutusofborg1 about it he s maintaining virtualbox in debian and ubuntu if anything needs to
startmeeting that seems to have gone well mirv and mitya57 are on k d and we chat about updates they
wat more or less all of plasma kf5 and some apps 1
discussion has just be in the cc so far all of these projects are built http anonscm debian org cgit
right i read that the first time i might need more detail to understand the connection between all of this
thanks i m usually happy enough if i don t get mail or any notification of jenkins p 1
sure the people who actually decide to get involved read the docs and take the plunge are very much the
understood the kubuntu sessions in the last two uoses seemed very popular though 1
i m going to try and recruit you again so i would n t say that submitted rt regarding updating
current chairs cprofitt czajkowski dholbach mhall119 pleia2 maybe we could invite the kubuntu team to one of the next community
looks like you re well covered there user community participation in kubuntu among other things 1

oh yes failing to read my list or scrollback sorry enjoy 1
to be clear we ve raised it to canonical legal and weekly isos from it 0
i think we may crash twitter when we launch that does n t seem to be getting anywhere time to
what do you build and or test there can you go into detail about how it is hurting kubuntu development
done shadeslayer used to be working full time on kubuntu now he s not 1
and then twist their arms to actually nominate themselves best stop giving in to their stalling and just make a
we are having some issues to get people to the nominations i m not sure i understand 1
that s not how the cc operates sure 0
is this an immediate effect of ubuntu trademarks look into oem snap dtb handling 0
is what 1
help brian with software properties gtk questions you said the policy hurts kubuntu development then you mention rohan not working
make a public statement saying it is untrue and irrelevent trusty sru for 1429041 0
has the trademark ip question caused you problems with your employment riddell is shadeslayer okay with you going into detail
as we re really out of time what do n t you understand 1
o they are the ones making the claim so again the cc does n t have any standing to make
now working on 0 5 due tuesday bugfix release blue systems is worried that canonical will want to restrict derivates
best stop giving in to their stalling and just make a statement has blue systems contacted canonical about this 1
yes it does it is the ubuntu council it can make a claim on ubuntu s behalf why not just
17 31 riddell http www ubuntu com legal terms and policies intellectual property policy still says otherwise you will need
kubuntu is not a derivative we do care about our derivatives and this harms them right i read that the
you keep asking us to make a statement and we ve already said we wont do that not until we
i ll drop riddell and shadeslayer a mail about the q a and we can have a look at the
i want the cc to give up on canonical legal who are clearly not interested in fixing it and make
shoot and if the cc does n t agree with that statement 1
i have to go for spanish class hasta luego in order to make a public statement on a legal matter
and yes what slangasek said it sounds a lot like the trigger change that s just making excuses 1
does n t affect international law it affects the free software licenses imho but ianal the connections 0
i failed miserably at that than make one you do agree on but do n t let someone claim ubuntu
jodh i do not see it as an excuse riddell but i would like to ask you to be more
i ve chatted to a few folks who are very helpful on irc on ubuntu uk none thought they could
if blue systems or shadeslayer have been specifically impacted by this issue i would encourage them to talk directly to
do you know if a bug is open for it i agree 1
so much less duplicate work all around there is a topic that riddell has raised i am not sure we
looked into a lxc security issue related to seccomp so that s more of a question for the community team
that is the issue that we re currently sorting out we ll not be able to do anything now done
most of the time an estimate on your trip s cost is all we need discussion has just be in
and we can and do adjust what is paid when things like ticket prices change 14 00 jcastro i will
if you apply first with a rough estimate we can at least approve it and then either pay you before
as we re really out of time you did say it s like a 10 day 2 week turn around
jodh typically but not always 1

sorry was late getting away hi kubuntu people nominated 1

it will but probably not for the next lts for what 1
i was looking for a word like voluntold and then twist their arms to actually nominate themselves 0
i recall some of them oh sorry we re talking about the ubuntu membership board 1

larsu did you register a blueprint session for the gsettings security work for uos you know what needs to be
larsu blog shows it will be announced today http www markshuttleworth com honestly i do n t know why we
what precisely is required gsettings exists exactly for the needs we have on desktop good morning 0
larsu the current need is to store access some easy settings we could do something easier for those special cases
we are going to need to isolate gsettings for the desktop usecase in the futur anyway so better to tackle
gtkfilechooser in vivid does n t sort folders on top anymore very 1
this is interesting in fact https blueprints launchpad net ubuntu spec convergence 1505 gsettings confinement 1
also can you send me whatever you have on the desktop widgets work so i can prepare for that session
thanks seems so p 0
all i care about is that the settings are stored somewhere that does n t constitute a privacy leak desktop
let s focus on discussing the proper solution and work on that scheduling maybe you can borrow the community or
core probably yes all that is required is a place for a few things for apps to query locale vibrate
have i mentioned i m not dictating implementation thursday is fine for me 0
changing the default would make sense to me a new service with no feature than letting you read write some
that s why desrt is doing it reuse is fine by me i do n t know enough about this

this is interesting in fact originally i planned to finally do that kite ride but once again bad weather 0
how do you mean on fedora there is an option for that on the right click context menu 0
though please avoid a snappy conflict like u s d xsettings plugin 1
dunno either larsu would thursday 18utc work for that session 1
changing the default would make sense to me thanks 0
thursday is fine for me 1500 utc on core is taken can you do 1800 0
i hear kats are available on the internetz add them for instant kitkat 18utc as well 1
rather than having access to the whole database thu at 8pm works for me i agree sort folders has to
