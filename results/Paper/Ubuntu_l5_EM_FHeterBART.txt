i ll have a look at it in a bit i m not sure what the best way to do
i think we need to make sure we re not going to have to do that every time we do
i think so i think it would be better to just have a list of the versions and then just
i think we can do that but i think we need to be able to do it in a different
i think we can do that but i think it would be a bit more complicated to do it in
i think it would be better to just have a list of all the methods that are called and then
i think we can do that but i m not sure how we can get it to work i m
np i m not sure if we can do that today but i m sure we can get it done

i think that should be sufficient i think that s what i was thinking of but i m not sure
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not going to be able to test in on

i m 99 sure this will fix it i m 99 confident this will help it 0

i m not sure what you re asking about but i think you re right i think we should have
i think so i m not sure what the problem is but i think it s a good idea to
i think it s fine to leave them as they are but i m not sure if it s worth
i think it s a good idea to have a separate branch for the juju core branch i think it
i think it s a good idea to have a separate branch for the same issue i m having with
i think it s a good idea to have a separate branch for each of those but i m not
i ll do that now i m not sure about warranty probably not or not more than like 30 60
i m not sure i understand the question i m just wondering if we should have it on the juju
i m not sure if you can do that for me i m not really sure what you re asking
i do n t think so i think we have a few examples in state 1
i think we should have a state server that writes to the state server and writes to it i think
i think it s a good idea to have a state server that does the same thing as the client
i think it s a good idea to have a separate test for the new go 1 2 bug 1449345
i m not sure if we should do that i think it s a good idea to have a txn
i m not sure what you mean by mgo change and apply i m not saying it s bad but
i think we do n t update collections in collections we just update them with the new collections and then
i think we should do a collection update in state proper i think we need to add a collection to
i m not sure what you mean by updateid i ca n t repro success with that change is it
i m not sure what you re asking about but i m not 100 sure what the issue is i
i m not sure what you mean by that but i think it s a good idea to have a
i m not sure if it s in 1 22 or not i m not familiar with the codebase so
i m not sure if you can add it to 1 22 but i ll talk to you about adding

i ll do that thanks i ll try to get back to you in a bit 0
ok thanks i ll try to get it in before eod 0
i m not sure what you mean by that but i m not aware of any other way to do
i m not sure what the fix is i m not familiar with the code so i ca n t
i think it s ready i ll try to get it in before the end of the week i m
i think you need to set the size to 0 6mb i think it s ready 0
it s a bug in the store it s not a feature of the store 0
i m not sure i understand what you mean by that i m not a fan of the default gtk
i m not sure i understand what you mean i m not aware of any plans to ship ubuntu gtk

i m not sure what you mean by that but i m not a gamer so i m pretty sure
pong i m not sure if it s a blocker but i think it s worth it 0
i m not sure if you saw my comment about the delay but i think it s a bug in

i m just finishing some stuff for will probably get to it around 11am the change comes later but i
i ll try to get to it later but i ll be back in a bit i ll try and
i ll try to get to it later today and then i ll be back later but i ll have
i ll try to reproduce it in a bit i ll try it now i m not sure what the
i am not sure what you mean by the state addipaddress i am just trying to understand what the problem
i am not sure what you mean by alive address i am just checking the code that is used to
i m not sure i understand the question i m just trying to understand the code to understand what the
i see i m not sure if it does but i think it does 1
i see i m not sure if it does but i think it does 1
i m not sure i understand the question but i m not convinced that it s the same thing as
i m not sure what you mean by that but i m not seeing the error in the test i
i ll have a look at the code to remind myself what was implemented yeah i can recreate the failure

i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the code so i ca n
i m not sure what you mean by the new machine is dropped from the addresser s list but i
i m not sure i follow the logic you re using but i think it s a good idea to
i ll be there in 30 minutes i m not sure what you re asking about 0
i m not sure what the issue is but i think it s a race condition between the two machines
i m not sure what the problem is but i think it s a bug in the worker itself i
i m not sure what you mean by setup i m just saying that it s not a good idea
i m not sure what you mean by setup where it should start the watcher does n t solve the
i m not sure what the best way to do it is to just merge it and let it sit
i m not sure what the issue is but i m not seeing it in the logs i m just
i m not sure what the os call is but i think it s a good idea to have a
i think the os call is more important to the user than the os one i think it s a
i m not sure what you mean by the same i m just looking at the code now 1
i think so i m not sure i understand the question 0
i m not sure if it s worth it but i think it s a good idea to have a
i think it s a race condition in the worker itself but i m not sure if it s related
i think it s a good idea to have a separate collection for each of those so that we can
i m not sure what you mean by buffered i think it s a case of the machine being dead
i think it s a good idea to have a separate set of tests for each machine i m not
i m not sure what you mean by dead i think it s a good idea to have a method
i m not sure if it s a good idea to have a separate machine id for each machine i
i m not sure what you mean by remove it i m not saying it s wrong but it s
i m not sure what you mean by remove machine id i m just saying that it s not a
i think it s a race condition in the test i m not sure what the reason is but i
i think it s a race condition in the test itself but i do n t know how to test
i think it s a good idea to have a separate watcher for the watcher i m not sure how
i think it s a good idea to have a separate watcher for the watcher i m not sure if
i m not sure what you mean by direct state watcher i m just saying that it s not a
i think that s a good idea i ll have a look at it in a bit bug 1479653 opened
i m not sure what you mean by remove i m not familiar with the code so i ca n
i ll take a look at that bug 1479653 opened state depends on system clock tech debt juju core triaged
i m not sure if we want to make that standard practice but some people may certainly ask for it
i m not sure if it s a good idea to have a separate list of all the ensuredead and
sure i ll try to find it in the logs and see if i can find it i m not
i m not sure what you mean by trace level image i m just saying that if you re not
i think i ll just leave it for now i ll try to reproduce it in 1 24 3 4
i think this is a problem with 1 22 6 not 1 24 3 4 the upgrade is failing when
i think that s a good idea i ll try to get it landed in 1 22 6 and see
i think that is a good idea i think i will have to make some changes by hand i see
i think i ll just make a change to the api and then add a test to ensureipaddressdeadop and then
i think i see what you re saying i m not sure what you mean by the first four addresses
i m not sure i understand the question i m trying to solve i m not quite sure what you
i m not sure if that s the right place to ask but i think it s a good idea
i think the issue is that the worker does n t know about the state server and it does n
i m not sure what you mean by buffering i m not saying it s a bad thing but it
i think it s a bit of a wart but i think it should be possible to do it in
i ll be back in a bit i ll be around later to help with the other bits but i
i m not sure if it s worth it but i think it s fine to do that i m
i m not sure what you mean by isolating the issue i m not familiar with the codebase so i
i m not sure what you re asking but i m not 100 sure what the issue is i m

i ll try to get to it in a bit thanks 1
i think i ll just merge it into master and then merge into master i ll see if i can

i think that s what we want to do but i m not sure how to do it i m

i think we can do that but i m not sure how we can make it work with the current

i think that s fine i ll try to find a way to do it in the meantime i m
i think it would be better to have a separate service for the docker registry and for the private docker

then click on it virtualenv bin pip install upgrade i think you need to install the package from the ppa
you can also use the virtualenv bin pip install upgrade to install the package you want to use and then

i m not sure what you mean by that i m not a kubuntu dev so i ca n t
i have a problem with kubuntu 15 04 i have a kubuntu 14 04 installation and i want to install
i think it s a bug in the kernel that the patch is applied against i do n t know
i m not sure what you mean by patching the patch i m not familiar with the patch so i
i have also looked at the exact location where the patch applies it looks the same i have also read
i do n t know what you mean by source package i m not sure what you re asking about
i m not sure what you mean by restricted i m not familiar with the broadcom stuff but i m
i m probably doing something wrong because using apt get install the package builds just ok i m not sure
i m not sure what you mean by that i m just trying to understand what you re trying to
i m not sure what you mean by trace it manually but i m not familiar with the installation process
i ll try to find out what the issue is and report it to the bug team i ll try
i m not sure i follow you but i m not going to patch it for you i m going
i m not sure what you mean by that i m afraid i do n t know what you re
i m not sure what you mean by wrong channel i m not a gamer so i ca n t
i m not sure what you mean by spread ubuntu i m sure you ll find a lot of people

you can always ask in ubuntu server if you want to try it out if you have a problem with
i m not sure what you re asking about but your local is the method by which you would normally
i m not sure what you mean by hardware support but i think there is a lot of work to
i m not sure if there is a wiki page for that but i m not aware of one that
i m not sure what you mean by doubt i m not a fan of the xfce4 panel but i
i have a question about ubuntu 12 04 i have a problem with my wifi card and i have to

thanks i ll add it to the bug then i ll try to reproduce it 0
i m not sure what you mean by removing it but i m not aware of any other way to
ok i ll add udm to that bug yeah i m just going to run through the rest of the

i ll take a look at it thanks 1
i ll take a look at it now i m not sure what the underlying issue is but i think

i m not sure it s always scary when someone asks that with a d alexabreu can you try to
i m not sure what you mean by fail i m not familiar with the code so i ca n
i m not sure if it s a known issue or not but i m not seeing it in the
davidcalle i m not sure if it s a regression or a feature that s been fixed in the past
dholbach yes in general people are n t supposed to be using proposed and ci does have tests running 1
davidcalle i m not sure what the problem is but i m sure it s something to do with the
davidcalle i m not sure what the problem is with the autopilot tests but i m sure it s something
i think i m going to have to do some more work to get it to work i m not
i think it s a good idea to have a setup that runs the tests and then run the tests
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the code i m just using
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the process of building a custom
i think we should have a separate promotion for the three channel model and a separate one for the stable
i m not sure i understand what you mean by that i m not a developer i m just a
i m not sure if i understand your question but i m involved yeah 0
i m not sure if that s the right way to go but i m not opposed to it being
i think it s a good idea to have a test case for that i think it would be better
i think the consumer should be able to run a test image without having to do anything special to it
i think we should have a bug for that i think it s a bit of a stretch to say
i do n t think so i m not sure if it s worth it but i think it s
i think it would be a bit more work to have a bootability check for proposed images i think it
i think it s a bit of a hack but it s the ci infra that is the problem so
i m not sure what you mean by third channel i m not familiar with the process of getting the
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the process of building the silo
i m not sure what you mean by recovery i m not 100 sure i understand what you re trying
i think it s vivid i think i have 38m of log files 1

i think it s a bug in the uitk itself i think it is a bug with the ui and
i m not sure that we have a way to get the current version of devel proposed to work i
i think it s a bit of a stretch but i think it is a good idea to have a
i think it s a bug in the logrotate code that is causing the crash i think it is the
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the code used by the click
i m not sure if it s worth it but i think it s fine to have it in the
i m not sure what you mean by verify it did a check 0

i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the process of turning it off
yes i mean the crash is not in the app itself but in the logrotate itself i think it s
i m not sure what you mean by no changes i m just saying that it s not something we
i think it s a bug in the kernel that we need to fix i do n t think it
i m not sure what you mean by stop waiting i m not familiar with the process of running it
i m not sure what you mean by prompt did you try to install the sdk manually 1
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the process of getting the silo
i m not sure what the problem is but i m not seeing any logrotate failures in the logs i
i think it s a good idea to have a cron job for this i m not sure what the
i m not sure what you mean by blocked it i m not saying it s a bad thing but
sure i ll do that now i m not sure what the problem is 0
i think we should grab the fix unless we dont think the files will get corrupted now i think we
i think we should only log when in developer mode i think we need to make sure that the app
i think we can do that but it is useless when we re attached to crash reports 1
i m not sure i understand the question i m just saying that it s useless when the crash reports
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the process of getting the fix
i m not sure what you mean by that popups i m not saying that it s not bad but
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not a fan of the default desktop environment but
i think it s a bit more common to look for patterns like which crash the crash is in and
i think it s more likely that the crash is due to the app not being able to read the
i m not sure what you re asking about but i think you re looking for something that s not
i think we should just make a new manager and start looking at the code that s causing the issue
i m not sure what you mean by block but i think it s a good idea to have a
i m not sure if i understand your question but i m not going to be able to help you
i m not sure if it s a crash or a crash report but i m not 100 sure if
i think it would be useful to have a list of the crash reports for each app i do n
i think it would be good to have a list of the crash reports for each app i think it
i think it was last year i think it s been a while since i ve done it 0
i m not sure i understand your question but i m not saying that we should force people into usin
i m not sure what you mean by that but i m sure you can find a solution if you

i think i found it thanks 1
i m not sure if that s the right answer but i m not 100 sure i d like to
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not a developer so i do n t know
i m not sure if it s a bug or a feature of the phone but i m not aware
i m just going to run through the code now and see if i can get something done i m
i m not sure how to verify it fails on a bad click i m not even sure how it
i think we can do that in unit tests but i think we need to make sure we do n
i m not sure how to run it i m not familiar with the code so i ca n t

i think it s a bug in the click s code that we do n t have a chroot agent
i m not sure if it s worth it but i m not a big fan of the old click
i m not sure what you mean by grabbing error i m not seeing the error in the udm logs
okay i ll try to find out what s going on with the silo then i ll ask the qa
i m not sure if you can do that with the current image though i m not aware of any
i m not sure i understand the question i m just wondering if we should have a mechanism for that
i do n t think the udm status trickles down i m not sure what the problem is with that

you can use the ubuntu kernel channel for more info or ask in linux kernel or linux kernel mailing list
i m not sure what you mean by learning about the kernel but i m not familiar with the kernel
i think you can build it locally and then build it in a chroot for the sake of learning about
you can use the kernel from the ubuntu repo for that you can use apt get build dep linux image
you can use apt get dist upgrade to upgrade to the latest kernel if you want to do that but
i have a question about the ubuntu touch meta package i m trying to install ubuntu on a macbook pro
i think the stages are initrd and initrd initrd i think i have a problem with my ubuntu 14 04

i m not sure what you mean by enable disable i m not familiar with the code so i ca

i m not sure what you mean by that i m not really sure what i m doing there but
i m not sure what you mean by header i m not aware of any header that does that i
i think it s a bug in the header but i do n t know if it s the same
i do n t think so i do nt have a header on the main page but i do have
i m not sure what you mean by header actions i m not really sure what the problem is with
i m working now on a separate header component that you can put in any item i m writing a
i think we should probably just make the header part of the page instead of the mainview then i think
i think i m going to have to do some more work to get the new version of the camera
i m not sure if it s a bug or not but i think it s the same thing i
i m not sure if header actions will be enough for the page mainview but i think it s enough
ok i ll try that then i guess i ll just have to wait for the header to come up
i think we need to add a header to the header to make it work with the header as well
i think i found the problem i m not sure if i can fix it but i think i can
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not really sure what the issue is with that
i m not sure what you mean by header api doc https docs google com document d edit heading h
i m not sure if you can do that for me i m not really sure what you mean by
i m not sure i follow you there i m not really sure what you mean by header header i
i m not sure if you can make it work with the header but it s a good idea to
i m thinking to make it part of the headerstyle but that part still needs to be worked out i
i think header will be something that behaves like a header the hiding and showing but its contents is empty
i think header will be a header filled with the stuff that we have now in the header so that
i m not sure what you mean by header i m not really sure what the issue is with the
i m not sure what you mean by headerconfiguration contents prop i m not saying that it should be a
yes i think so but i do n t know if it s the same as the other apps 0

i m not sure what you mean by the scrollable page i m not saying that it should be a
i m not sure if i understand your question but i think i understand the problem you are trying to
i think you can do it with the flickable item but i do n t know if you can make
i think you can do it with the header item but i m not sure if you can easily do
i think i ll just have to add a new item to the bottom of the page and then add
i m not sure if you can do that but i m not 100 sure if it s possible to
i think you can do it directly it has a button to hide the header but it s not visible
i think that s the best solution but i m not sure how to do that i m afraid i
i think the header should be in the headerlayout of the header i think it s a good idea to
i think that s what i was thinking of but i do n t know how to do that i
i think you can do that with the actions in the header but i do n t know how to
i think the header will be the same as the actions in the header but the header is the same
i think you can do that with the header header but i do n t know if you can make
but you can also have a rectangle inside the header so if you want it aligned with the item you
but you can also have item rectangle header inside the header and then you can have item header rectangle inside
i think i just got what ahayzen was saying i think i have a problem with the header i have
i m not sure what you mean by header actions i m not saying that it s not a bad
i think we should have a separate page for the action action and the second column to always be the
i think it s wip but i do n t know if it s a good idea to have a
i think it is a wip branch for now i think it will be ready for review in a bit

i think it will be possible to have multiple development frameworks for different versions of the same app in the
i think we can do that but i m not sure how to do that i m afraid i do
i think we need to make sure that the framework is updated and updated to reflect the changes we have
i think it s a good idea to have a header inside the app that changes its height but it
i think you can do it directly with the header header but i m not sure if you can use
i think it s a good idea to have a header inside the header so that it can be used
i think it s in the works but i do n t know if it s ready yet i m
i m not sure if you can make it work with the development framework but if you want to use
i think i have a solution for that but i do n t know how to do it i m
i think it s a good idea to have a separate header for each app i m not sure if
i think so yes they will be on stable phones eg ota7 or only proposed the scrollable header e g
i think we are talking about the same thing but i do n t know if we are going to
i think we can do that with the ota8 milestone and then we ll call 1 3 stable on stable
i think it s the same issue with the location service i m not sure if it s related to
i m not sure if it s a bug or not but i m not aware of any bug that
i think it s a bug in the uitk itself i think it is a bug that the ui is
i think it s a good idea to have a separate header height for each app i think it will
i think the problem is that the header will be a header that is not the height of the radio
i think you can do that with the layouts in the store but i m not sure if you can
ahayzen and hey we will have a new palette finally some proper semantic color values there normal focused hovered and
i think we should have a theme for the default theme and then a theme to the default one for
i think i found the problem i m not sure what you mean by that i do n t think
i think we need to add a comment to the bug so that we can add the comment to that
i think we need to change the coloring in the menus to be more consistent with the actual layout of
i think the palette should be the same as the palette in 1 3 and below but i do n
i m not sure what you mean by update from 1 2 to 1 3 i m not saying that
i m not sure what you mean by column configurations for infinite amount cof columns conditional activation of those and
i ll be back in a bit i ll be around for a bit but i ll try to get
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not really sure what the problem is but i
i think we need to get the discussion started first and then get the mir team to work on it
i think we need to get the discussion started in the right direction and then move to a more concrete
i agree its not ready but it will need to be at some point you need to find some team
i m not sure what you mean by that i m just saying that it s not ready for people
i m not sure if you are concerned by this i would say raise it to the technical board so
i m not sure if you can get to canonical team s meeting today i ll be there in a
hey mlankhorst how are you i m not sure what you mean by that 0
i m not sure if it s a problem with the archive or not but i m not aware of
i m not sure if that s the right answer but i think it s a good idea to have
i m not sure if i understand your question but i m not a member of a group that s
i m not sure if it s worth it but i m not a member of the archive team so
i m not sure if canonical is around but i m sure they ll be around i m not aware
i think canonical is a canonical partner and canonical is not a canonical member i think that s a good
i agree with that but i disagree with the idea that canonical is providing support for things canonical is not
i m good thanks i m not sure what the best way to do that is to just have a

i m not sure what you mean by that i m not saying it s a good thing but it
i m not sure what you mean by gom i m not familiar with gom so i ca n t

i ll do that now and then i ll upload and self reject the new one i ll do the
i ll do that now i m not sure what the issue is but i m sure it s something
i m not sure what you mean by that i m sure but swift is where i noticed installs fail
i ll do that and then i ll upload and self reject the rest of the packages i m sure
i m not sure if i was doing it right but i m not entirely sure if it s worth
i m not sure i understand the question but i think it s reasonable to assume that the old triggers
i m not sure if it s worth it but i m not entirely sure if i m doing it
i m not sure if it s worth it but i m not entirely sure if the test is passing
i m not sure how to check that but i m sure it s possible that pitti or someone is
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the process of getting the init
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the code so i ca n
i just skimmed but i do n t actually see anythign in the bug report i ll try to find
i think it s a good idea to have a bug report for that i ll try to find it
i do n t know i m not sure i understand the question i m just trying to understand the
i m not sure if it s a regression in the tests but it s likely that they re not
i m not sure if it s a bug in the test itself but i think it s the case
i think i slightly prefer that update rc d calls daemon reload i m not sure what the difference is
i m not sure i understand your question but i m not familiar with the process of doing it so
i do n t know the package much about dpkg triggers but i do nt know how to register them
i m not sure if it s a deb thing but i think it s the same thing i m
i m not super picky about the solution mind you but i do think it s rc for both vivid
i do n t have it i ll check it out thanks for the info i ll try to find
i m not sure if you can make it work with the inotify argument but i m not convinced that
i m not sure if i understand your question but i m not going to argue against it i m
i m not sure if it s worth it but i m not convinced it s a regression in the
i m not sure if it s worth it but i think it s a reasonable conclusion i m not
i think it s a bug in the initramfs itself but i do n t think it has been fixed
i m not sure if you can get a better answer but i d like to know if you have
i m not sure if that s the right thing to do but i m not entirely sure if it
i m not sure what you mean by that but i think you re right it s a bit confusing
i m not sure if it s a bug in the initramfs or a feature of the initrd but it
i m not sure if you can find the source package for a given binary package the apt cache show

i think it s a bit of a hack but i think it should be done natively in c i
i do n t know i do nt know what triggers them but i think it s a bug in
i think it s a bit overkill but i ve not noticed under triggering i guess there s a bug
i think it s safe to ignore the triggers and just use the untriggering one i think it should be
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not seeing any trigger in the logs i m
i m not sure if it s a race or not but i think it s probably a race in
i m not sure if it s worth it but i m not entirely sure if the issue is just
i think we ve settled on update rc d and or trigger to paper over things for now we just

i ll get back to this on monday i ll get to this in vivid and it broke things weird

i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the new features in the latest
i m not in a tech job i see that the time seems to change by an hour based on
i do n t think so i m not in a tech job 0
i m not sure what the problem is but i think it s a bug in the sdk that we

thanks i ll try that now thanks 1
i m not sure what the problem is but i think it s a bug in autopilot that we should

i am what gerry did was basicaly to patch the globalrect so it adds up the bar size in case
i think i have a fix for that but i do n t know how to fix it i ll
i m not sure what the problem is but i m not 100 sure what to do with the silo
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the code so i ca n
i m not sure if it s worth it but i m not seeing any failures in the tests so
ok i ll try to reproduce it in a bit i ll be back in a few minutes 0
i m not sure what you mean by patching it i m not aware of any changes to the gu
i m not sure i understand the problem but i m not convinced that it s the problem i m
i m not sure what you mean by global rect i m not saying that it should be the same

i m not sure if it s worth it but i think it s a good idea to have a
i m not sure what the best solution is for you but i think it s a good idea to

i m not sure i understand what you mean i m not familiar with the gerrys code 1
i m not sure what the issue is but it s a known hack that they need to remove it

i think it should be a part of the autopilot test i m not sure how to define it i
i m not sure if you can help me with that but i m not familiar with the autopilot test
i think that s the problem i m not sure what the actual problem is i m sure it s
i m not sure what you mean by set up the job i m not saying it s not a
i think i have a fix for that but i m not sure how to do it i ll try
i think we should be able to do that in the future but i m not sure how to do
i think we can do that but i m not sure if either team as a decree or whatever but
i m not sure if either team as a decree or whatever but my possibly incorrect understanding is that ci
i think we should just do it in the ci lab and then we can do it later on i
i think we should do that but i think it s a bit wasteful to do that when we have
i think it s a good idea to split step 2 into two steps and then add step 2 to
i m not sure i understand the question i m just saying that it s not that easy to modify
i m not sure if you can reproduce the issue with the latest image i m not seeing the issue
i m not sure if you can do that for me i m not familiar with the code so i

i think it s a bug in the indicator network indicator that s the one i m looking at 1
i think it s a bit of a stretch but i think it should be fixed by the next ota
i m not sure if we can do that on mx4 but i think we can try it on desktop
i m not sure what you mean by talk to mhall119 i m not a dev of the phone so
i m not sure what the issue is but i m not seeing it in the store yet i ll
i think it was in ota7 but i do n t know if it was on ota8 or not i

i ll try to reproduce it again with the new branch and see if i can reproduce it i m
i m not sure i understand your question but i m not familiar with the codebase i m afraid i
i think it s a good idea to have a separate repository for all the projects that are hosted on
i m not sure what you re asking but i m not familiar with git git push set git git

i think you need to use the git repository name for the project name not the git repo name 1

i m not sure i understand the question i m just trying to understand how to get the source package
i do n t think so i do nope 1
i do n t think so i do nt have a patch for that yet i do have a bug
i think i have a patch for that but i do n t know how to fix it i m
i think i found the problem with the patch i did n t change the patch to include the patch
i think that s the problem i m not sure i understand the question i m trying to solve but

i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the process of getting the package
i think i can do that i m not sure if i can make it work with the new lib

i think we should talk about it in the release meeting i think we can do that but i m
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the code so i ca n
i think that s the problem i m not sure what you mean by the specific packages 1
i think that s the best solution for now i think i ll just leave it for now and let
i think that s a reasonable approach but i m not sure how to do that i m afraid i
i m not sure if you can do that but i m not entirely sure if it s worth it
i ll take a look at it i m not sure what s going on with the other packages i
i m on it in the evening just the demotions 0

i ll start on them thanks for the heads up 0
i m not sure what you mean by that i m not familiar with the process of building the package

i m not sure i understand the question i m not familiar with systemd services i m just guessing i
i think it s a good idea to add a service to systemd services i think it would be good
i mean the new logic is n t in the initramfs itself but in the systemctl scripts i think it

i m not sure if i understand your question but i m not going to be able to reproduce it
i m not sure if there is a way to do that but i m not 100 sure if it
i m not sure if it s worth it but if it does n t wait for ethx then it
i m not sure if it s worth it but i think it s fine to wait for ifup if
i m not sure if it s worth it but i think it s a good idea to have a

i have a sim pin on my phone and it works fine on my desktop but not on my laptop
i think it s the same issue i m not sure if it s related but i m sure it
i never used wipe cache just ubuntu device flash touch channel ubuntu touch devel proposed i never used delete cache
i do n t know what you mean by wipe cache i do nt know what happens if you wipe
i think the home dir is in home phablet cache upstart unity8 log i think it s a bug in
i have n t seen it in the image i have ntfs 0

i m not sure i understand the question but i m not a big fan of the idea of using

i think you need to add a ppa for it to be able to deploy a puppet server i think
i m not sure what you mean by provisioning i m not familiar with puppet i m afraid i do
i m not the one telling you i use zenoss i m the one who told you i used zen
i m not sure what you mean by monitor disks i m just looking for a place to put my
i have a problem with my ubuntu server i have a server that i want to use for a project
i think i have a problem with the server i have two boxes with puppet and two with zenoss on
i m not sure i understand what you mean by monitoring the raid level i m just saying that it

i m happy with utc i m not sure if i can get it to work with the new charm

i m not sure if it s worth it but i think it s a good idea to have a
i think we need to do a pr for 1 23 as well i think it s a good idea
i think it s a bug in the charm itself i think it was the first time i saw it
sure i ll take a look at it in a bit i m not sure what the issue is but
sure i ll take a look at it now i m not sure what the issue is but i m
